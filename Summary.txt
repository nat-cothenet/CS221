Instead of sleeping pills, hubby and I take one or two Valerians instead.Occasionally, Valerian will give me a headache if I take it too soon before bedtime.I also take this with 5-HTP.The Valerian caps I was taking were larger, so I take 6 of these an hour before I want to go to sleep.I I take one if I want to calm down, or two before I go to bed.

The store brand was also tropical flavored, but were more mild in flavor.These generic brand of antacid tablets are smaller (i.e.The assorted fruit flavor is okay but I prefer the Target brand in berry or tropical.These also seem a little expensive considering they are only 500mg and this particular one does not appear to be eligible to use as an add-on to make your order of other products reach the free shipping level.Given all that, I'm not sure I would recommend these antacid tablets.But are they really a good value?I purchased these after I found I was needing an antacid often enough to look for one that is not only effective, but also didn't cost a fortune.While they are slightly more expensive than Good Sense and Tums, I now prefer taking another brand that not only includes enzymes but also has xylitol instead of dextrose, so taking at bedtime is better on my teeth.These Good Sense tabs are good to have around during the day, but I'll probably depend more on the other brand (Axia3).And if you take products like the above, you probably already know the following, but just in case...Antacids can change the way your body absorbs the other medicines you are taking.

If you've been looking for a reason to kick back in the tub with a glass of wine, some candles and a quality shave cream/gel...a safety razor is what you've been missing.Firstly,I am amazed at how much closer the safety razor shaves my legs.Another advantage of using a safety razor is that any brand of double-edge blade will fit, so you are not married to one brand.While it is heavier than a drugstore razor (this is all-metal), it is light for a safety razor.I have used a safety razor for a couple of years now and have enjoyed the pleasure of shaving once again.

I found this plain whey product and was happy with the way I can use it in a variety of smoothies without adding a strange taste that might clash with certain ingredients.This is a very good organic choice for whey protein.I like that it is not flavored; it blends well in a blender when making a smoothie and doesn't add any weird taste to the smoothie.CAUTION- you will taste the Stevia, so if you don't like Stevia find a different shake.I've made a Whey Protein Smoothie after my workout for a year now... and it's good stuff.

I've noticed in the past year that this product works better over time, and that it is more effective at reducing joint pain than just glucosamine and chondroitin alone.Aging is not what I thought it would be, and this product does help, as long as you don't stop taking it.I told my parents about it and now they're on the subscribe & save plan, too!It's interesting, in the early months of our subscription, he would run out once in a while because he would take more than I had calculated for (taking 4 a day when he is really exerting himself, is more active at his already-active job, helps a friend move, etc).Reduced pain in her back & knees when taking the hydraplenish.I have not tried the Hydraplenish without MSM but  I think the MSM and the hyaluronic acid together works wonders!!

I have been using this just like normal laundry detergent and it seems to work fine...I have used some Seventh Generation items in the past, but I probably won't be trying this laundry powder again.The combination of half a handful of the Washing Soda and the Borax seem to do the trick, combined with detergent and maybe some Eucalyptus Oil or Cedar Wood Oil.I like Seventh Generation dishwasher gel, it seems to work better than Cascade, but this laundry detergent didn't do a very good job so I cannot recommend it.My only issue with this Seventh Generation Powder is that my clothes don't really smell clean after washing.It was good at removing stains and odors so it doesn't clean clothes just fine.I couldn't really smell that my clothes were clean, so what's the point in this being scented detergent then?I like my clothes to also smell clean when I wash them.I'm a fan of Seventh Generation products in general so I expected to like this laundry powder.

Good Sense One Daily Multivitamins are small and easy to swallow.A Good Basic Multivitamin With Iron Supplement.Good Sense One Daily Multivitamin with Iron Supplement is a good basic once daily vitamin, but it has no minerals.Every included vitamin it does have, which they show 11, is 100% of your daily value, since as Vitamin A, D, E, C, Vitamin B6 & B 12, Folic Acid, Niacin, Riboflavin, Thiamin.For those of you who do want a multivitamin with iron, the amount of iron in this supplement is 18 mg, which they also say is 100% of the daily value that you need.The tablet size I would say is just a regular size, which is nice, because some vitamins are like the size of horse pills.The Centrum multivitamins also contain a small amount of calcium, which these Good Sense vitamins do not have.

Since this product is mentioning made in GMP facility, it should conform to the correct FDA statements that are up to date.For the price for what I paid, it works out to 14 cents per softgel without shipping.The current Amazon price for the product is $35.95 (180 softgels) or 20 cents per softgel with free shipping.A more cost effective purchase is again Kirkland Natural Omega-3 Fish Oil currently selling here on Amazon for $8.75 for 400 (vs. $35.95 for 180 Assertive) softgels without shipping.However, as was pointed out by another reviewer, the Kirkland product contains soy like many other omega-3 dietary supplements.I have nothing against the company Assertive Wellness.You can go to any of your local grocery store's vitamin section and look at the labels of "natural fish oil" 1,000 mg and most of the time you will see the same ingredients as Assertive Wellness and many other 300 mg total omega-3s products sold here on Amazon including Kirkland Natural Fish Oil.This is what 10 times the price of Kirkland and other "natural fish oil" products you are getting with Assertive Wellness:  "food glaze, sodium alginate, stearic acid, veg.You are paying for the cost of the enteric coating and I can't see how this is ten times more expensive than the same fish oil that is in Kirkland and other generic "18/12" natural fish oil products.

As soon as a finish up this bottle I will not be repurchasing again.A little about my skin, Im 21 my skin color is tan about nc42 in mac, normal to dry skin type (winter but usually normal) no acne but occasional blemish during my period.My biggest concern is uneven skin tone, freckles, hyper pigmentation acne scarring and large pores around my nose and darkness around my mouthmy routine:1.after serum sinks in (which takes only a few seconds) i use a sunscreen, either neutrogena visibly even spf 30 or alba botanicals even advanced spf 15I try to make my skin care natural and also target pigmentation problems, raw goat milk (not powdered form) contains natural lactic acid which is good at brightening skin and fading marks, you can do your own research on that.It has been a month and half since using this serum so far I noticed this serum is very moisturizing due to the hylauronic acid, I have been using only 2 drops for my face including my neck and the bottle is still full so this should last me along time.It has retexurized my skin making it smoother and firm it plumps up your skin its great putting on foundation after because it gives you such a nice finish and a natural glow comes through.I think every serum gives you a glow because its very moisturizing.Also if I did have a blemish acne spot this serum heals it really fast and scarring is minimal the blemish dries up and peels off.As for pigmentation this did fade some fresh scarring I had from picking my skin and those seem to fading fine, older acne scars are still no where near gone and the darkness I have around my mouth is still there also freckles are still here.The only thing that I love about this serum as of now is just how it makes my skin smooth gets rid of any bumps and how moisturizing it is especially when I layer with sunscreen I get a nice dewy glow, that is pretty much all the good I see in this serumI wanted this serum to be it for me since it is natural and be an alternative to the pricey ole henriksen truth serum I use to use.I was looking forward for this product to fade all of my old acne scarring and brighten my skin but I guess my search continues and who knows I might have to go back to the truth serum if nothing works out I had my eyes on the skinceuticals phyto+ serumAlso!!I'm almost disappointed that this product might go rancid quicker because of this fault I keep my bottle in the drawer btwif you have any questions please comment below Doesn't seem strong enough for my skin but then again I don't have any acne on the surface only some under layered skin pigment dark spot issues that i'm trying to get rid of.

Typically I use Kirkland garbage bags that I buy at my local Costco for about fourteen dollars for 200 bags.However, I saw these bags during a recent trip to Costco, which had them on sale for about twelve dollars.These do work, but no better than the much less expensive Kirkland bags--hence my four star rating.To the contrary, I had more difficulty stretching these bags to fit onto my simplehuman trash can than I do with the Kirkland bags.Bottom line: Since these do not work any better than the Kirkland bags that I have been using, for me they are not worth the extra expense.If you do decide to buy these, shop for price.The current price on Amazon is more than double what my local Costco charges when these bags are on sale.

I really liked the P90X recovery drink but the price was hard to swallow (pun intended).I have this after a hard workout and need to get some protein into me.I think Endurox is more effective as a recovery drink, but if needed, I think you can use these two products interchangeably without too much of a difference in results.HOW TO USEDon't take Endurox as a meal replacement.For me, taste is really the most important thing in choosing a recovery drink (because they all do pretty much the same thing).Just be aware that recovery drinks tend to have a lot of calories (by necessity) so if you aren't going long or hard, you probably don't need a recovery drink.On the other hand, I went on a 2.5 hour hike, then had stuff to do and had no recovery drink and my legs were really hurting the next day.I love R4 and it seems to be working for me.

They are a bit pricey but if you have tough feet I would recommend you use these rollers first then use the blue rollers.This roller definitely removes the dead skin from my feet much better than the roller that originally came with the Micro Pedi.I would not use this on the pads of your fingertips or your palm, though; it's too rough for that.I would recommend what should use reasonable caution, with this is a reasonable powerful grooming tool in combination with the extra course rollers which work very fast and it would be very easy to over do it which I imagine could leave ones feet overly sensitive.This course roller really gets off the dead skin and makes your feet soft.these rollers work better than the blue ones if you really tough feeti use these to first remove the tough skin then the blue ones to smooth it outthey really leave your skin soft and smoothi recommend this I'm sure you don't want to read elaborations about funky feet, so I'll spare the graphic descriptions and just say that these REALLY work on tough callouses and leave feet baby-smooth.

The thing to remember which the booklet points out is you do not turn the machine on until you are over the sink, so you wont end up getting the counter etc wet.The large reservoir also acts as the unites cover, which makes for a neat clean bath counter.Also bought the WaterPik FLW-110 Power Whitening Flosser which makes this a great system for dental care.Good dental health can also mean great overall health, so I take healthy teeth and gums seriously and see these WaterPik items as a very affordable preventative care tools.My first dental water irrigator was a WaterPik and the operation was great.Not to mention, the thing has a two year warranty, so it can't be THAT bad.Simply make sure the reservoir is pushed down all the way so that the seal is closed to avoid leaks.Yeah it is a little messy, and it will take practice to get all my teeth done properly without looking in the mirror (supposed to do it in the sink) and still it splashes some but hey... at the dentist's it splashes too, and they even have a little suction thing to use!Oh and it is kinda noisy, but hey nobody ever complains about their vacuum cleaner or the toilet flushing...LOL.The one thing I would change is that as soon as you turn it on, it starts pumping a bit of water...I wish there was an on/off switch on the handle.I couldnt believe that there was that much left behind after I THOUGHT my mouth was clean!If you want a clean feeling in your mouth that you have never felt before, use this product and mix the water 50-50 with mouth wash.Now to the use...I use this thing daily and have never had a leak or accidentally knocked it off its base.When you first use it, your gums may bleed a little.

There is no science to back up this belief; however, plenty of people claim that homeopathic remedies of this type work for them, so who I am to say that they don't?One of the ingredients attributed to this product is nux vomica.Keep in mind that, at that point, I was expecting that it WOULD work because the few reviews on it were favorable, and this was before I looked up how homeopathic remedies are made.Each day he reported that it was the same, except one day (when I HAD used it) when he said my snoring was noticeably worse (but he was stuffy that night, too, so it was probably just something in the air), and one morning he said my snoring was better (when I had NOT used the spray, but I HAD taken an antihistamine).I'm always up for trying new things, because I know what works for one person might not work for another - and vice versa.This didn't work for me.I followed the instructions and hoped for the best, but this product had zero noticeable affect, according to my wife.Not sure what else to say about it.I am not saying the other reviewers singing this products praises are wrong.

Although the Amazon page does not say it, this product only works on about 75% of people who use it.To be honest, i think the pouch is only included to make the product seem a bit sexier and sensual, you have to get out "the little bag of magic" instead of "the thing that looks like a tube of lipstick".The gel itself has a slightly minty scent, and is what I would call a semi-gel... more liquid than, say, suntan lotion.Overall, I think the KY team got it right on just about everything, except for the Amazon page where it should really say that it only works for 75% of the users who tried it...You should still buy it, and try it, and hopefully Amazon's return policy will be generous enough to accept your return if you are in the 25%...It would be nice if there was more product for the price, but the results make it well worth it.Discreet.I think this product would be good for peri-menopausal, or menopausal women like me, who don't self lubricate like they once did, who suffer from vaginal dryness.A little help is all you need!I got this product for my wife, and she is very happy with it.

When I became interested in doing coffee enemas, I asked around to see what people were using for the enema kits.Alot of people were using disposable plastic enema bags you can get at Rite Aid or Save-On, etc.Also, the point of the enema is to detox, so why would I put the organic coffee in a PLASTIC(!)I've used it about 6-8 times over the last couple months and here are my thoughts:-The stainless steel can is nice because it is sterile, but not so nice because (a) you cannot see the level of the liquid and (b) because a good portion of your liquid goes to waste because it falls below the hole that allows it to flow into the tube.I wish I would have spend the extra money and gone with some of the fancier, better designed enema kits on the internet.

I purchased GOO GONE for some sticker removal at work.But if I removed one a really old sticker that had some serious stickiness to it, the GOO GONE just couldn't cut through it at all.For every application of GOO GONE that has worked, another substance could have done the job (like acetone or alcohol).But GOO GONE is a very safe chemical to use.There are apparently different types of adhesives used on labels, because on some jars that I tested it took the goo right off, and some it did not remove even after several applications and letting it sit for over an hour.It does work best if you follow the directions and spray it on, wait a while, wipe with dry cloth and then wash with soap and water.If you don't wash with soap and water you have a kind of a film left on the surface.I thought I would try it on some pine sap in my car, as it claims to work on that too.

Without distinguishing itself as having a significantly lower disinfection ingredient concentration than most multi-purpose solutions, I feel that Renu Sensitive is dangerously misleading as a product.Long Review:This Sensitive version of Renu does not contain the same polyhexamethylene biguanide, a well-studied and effective antimicrobial agent, that is used in some other brands, and possibly some versions of regular Renu Multi Purpose*.Renu Sensitive has the also-common polyaminopropyl biguanide, but at 1/2 the concentration that I've read it should be used at and of what I -think- regular Renu Multi Purpose contains*.I've read that both polyhexamethylene and polyaminopropyl (at > 2-10X Renu Sensitive's concentration) was shown to be very effective against Acanthamoeba, but I'm not clear on which might be better.However, I do know that when I can finally wear contacts again I'll either choose a new brand, go back to regular Renu multipurpose, or maybe even continue using Renu Sensitive, but be obsessively careful to keep my hands and storage case very clean every morning/night.Renu Sensitive was, in fact, easier on my eyes than the regular Renu Multi Purpose I'd been using for years.I haven't used it, but wouldn't give Renu Sensitive another chance without it.BTW I &lt;3 Amazon.

Been looking for a shaving cream that my husband and I could both use that wouldn't' irritate or have funny stuff in it and also wasn't really expensive.This is by FAR the best shaving cream I've ever used.I also think it gives me a closer shave than other shaving creams I used in the past.This is by far the best shaving cream I've ever used.And, though smell is super subjective, I prefer the scent of KMF to Ambrosia.If you are new to shaving cream (as opposed to aerosol pump shaving gels), be aware that it is a slightly different experience.

I suppose it may smell, "fresh" if you are used to chemical-laden products - I'm not!Washed off clean, package says it's hypoallergenic, yet has a lot of chemicals in it.I'm not sure why, when the product states, "for external use only", that when I already use a hydrating, unscented, non-drying liquid cleanser, why I'd need yet another product in the bathroom.It worked well on my skin, although the smell was just overwhelming & a bit too much, and not really pleasant.I suppose if you use regular soaps that can be drying & are already pH balanced (7.0 or close) that you might want to use something else, but it seems unnecessary since I already take pH, scents, and so on into consideration for any cleansers I use anywhere on my body.I didn't have any break-outs on my skin, but the scent was just too much for me, and I didn't find it very pleasant.There was nothing very distinctive between the Poise Wash and that bottle of cheap shampoo.Unlike me, some women may find this product helpful but I would strongly suggest they only use it in the shower, be sure that they use only a minimal amount and make certain they gently rinse the product off their body completely.I did not use it as an all over body wash, but I'm sure it would work just fine.It also does not leave a lingering scent on your skin.My choice of scents are essential oils, like lavender or something uplifting, like a citrus scent.Maybe this product will work for you better than it did for me, especially if you do not have sensitive skin, especially in your intimate area.Iam going to continue to use this, to see if I still have the same issue.I have no doubt that this is a mild product, tho not made up of natural ingredients.I seem to have better luck when I use natural products in all areas of my life, whether it's cleaning products, or things I use on my face or body etc.Iam sure for most of you, this product you will not have any issues with.I sincerely wish that had also been my experience too!Though I have only used this product once, the product caused irritation almost immediately after my first and last use of it.

Your sleep quality and quantity is the single most important thing you can do for your health.On the other hand, the Sweet Dreams mask is very silky & sexy and a really good item if you're into those kinds of experiences ;-) I would buy it for that :-)Update: I just bought 2 more of the Bucky Eye Shades -- a back-up for me (for when I can't find one) and one for my partner -- though he likes the Sweet Dreams too.Along with theBucky 40 Blinks, this sleep mask blocks out the most light of the five highly-rated sleep masks I've tried.I have &#34;dry eyes&#34; and it's smart for me to wear a sleep mask, and this one does a great job of covering my eyes to help protect them from drying.I have, and have used, one of the &#34;swim goggle&#34; style sleep masks and they do the mask part, but the sleep part is a struggle.These are the only eye shades I've found that block out all the light and feel comfortable.The mask blocks out light 100% and is comfortable on the face.HOWEVER, I sleep on my back and the velcro fastener is a bit uncomfortable.

But this persistent cough puzzled me, and when I almost passed out one morning after a coughing fit one of my fellow teachers let me use her inhaler (which helped) and told me she thought I must have asthma.The symptoms can in fact be so dramatic as to make some people feel they are experiencing a heart attack.Anyway, a little curtailing of my menu (going light on some spicier foods) and two little 20 mg. famotidines (the same basic medicine as in Pepsid AC), and I'm fine, and I stay that way as long as I remember to keep them at hand and take them EVERY day TWICE a day.They handle spot problems, not long term ones.AND ANOTHER THING: I'm not a doctor.I'm just telling you what worked for me.As for me, though, I have found I don't have to worry, as long as I consistently follow these simple instructions: one 20 mg. famotidine, twice a day.It's nice to receive your product in one piece instead of it being crushed.

I twisted my ankle while hiking and my boots failed to prevent injury, although I can't tell if it could have limited further injury.This orthosis is an ankle brace that you wear like a shoe and is substantially better than boots in terms of ankle support.I used this brace to stabilize my ankle from a chronic ankle sprain that I had for over a year.My ankle would not have healed as good without this brace.Anyway, the point is that I have been wearing ankle braces for a long time and the products in general are designed for people with problems like me.The biggest problem I have with this brace is that within 3 months of wearing one, I sprained my ankle badly, which is a pretty rare occurence when wearing an ankle brace.The ankle stabilizer brace was exactly what my son needed for support of his right foot.

I use it both to cut my hair and trim my beard.Advertised as a hair clipper that "puts professional power into your hand", I decided to get this and give it a try.I normally visit the barber once or twice a month, and not really because I like my hair too short but because I like to have the sides and sideburns trimmed, so I thought this could be a money saver if I could have a touch-up in between haircuts.Essentially I get my hair cut as short as possible so I jumped on this product as my real need is to have a dependable cutter that is easy to maintain and easy to use.It did a perfect job on my hair as my wife said that she found it easy to use while cutting even through some think hair here and there.The charge generally is long lasting and the unit fit perfectly into the corner of our sink in our bathroom.We've been using this clipper for almost 6 months now (about 10-15 hair cuts and trims) and it has been one of the better ones we've used.PROS: It is quiet and pretty strong (it doesn't get bogged down on longer hair).You can plug it in if the rechargeable battery is losing power.The weight/design make it easy to grip and use handle.My kids actually sit well through a cutting when I use this clipper.CONS: Hair gets stuck in the guards/attachments quite often.Even though the blades easily pull out to clean, it isn't so easy to clean as hair sticks to a little foam strip inside the case.It must be said that this clippers is too big for smaller areas; it is for hair cuts, not precise trimming.I'd recommend this product for those who want a quiet, strong, and easy to use hair clipper.-----------------------UPDATE: EDIT MAY 2012 - We've been using this clipper quite often for almost one year.

The thin regular paper plates are not economical if you have to use three or four to do the job that one of these Dixie Ultra plates does.I've had to double up these larger 10 inch dinner plates only if I felt the food was very heavy, but I was always able to save the bottom plate as unused because they NEVER soak through.In my opinion, if you're going to use paper plates for foods that are not dry, then you might as well buy a product that is worry-free.I used to buy paper plates at Sam's Club, but found that since I wasn't using the store that much, I dropped my membership there.I was delighted to find that these Dixie plates are sturdy and are a paper product, not Styrofoam!Most paper plates let the juices soak in and start to tear apart, so you are probably eating paper with your food, but that does not happen with these plates.

I wanted a trimmer that would allow me to shave to stubble length rather than shaving it clean with a razor.The trimmer takes a couple of hours for the battery to charge after which you can use it for some considerable time.The trimmer has an adjustable height knob on the back that goes from 0.5 mm to about 1cm so it's good for more than just stubble and can be used for longer hair too.Now with the stubble trimmer he always looks like he hasn't shaved for a day maybe and still quite clean and tidy as opposed to the scruffy look without.I do have an electric trimmer for my goatee, but it's not really designed for cutting right next to the skin, and can pinch a little bit when I use it to mow the facial hair.This "Stubble Trimmer Pro" is a fairly good solution.It's easy to clean with the brush that's included and you can also clean by safely running under tap water.This is strictly a trimmer, also good for trimming hair lines, but would not be used as a total face shaver.A great product for all of the men in your life.Thank you!Pam This is one of those niche products that really has only one use, but it does exactly what it is designed to do.

After using this toothpaste for a week my teeth were in such pain I could hardly eat.I know the enamel on my teeth is weak so I thought I'd give this brand a try but after one week I had to quit using it.Also I don't think this product has any whitening benefits so I can see that my teeth aren't as white.It's also supposed to protect the teeth from pain and sensitivity which it really hasn't for me but I have noticed that with this toothpaste I can feel that my teeth are kind of slippery, it's hard to describe but I can tell there is a layer of something on them after brushing with sensodyne.So...I think this may be a good toothpaste to prevent your teeth from becoming even more damaged and that's about it.

After taking Vit D oil for a year, I decided to change to a cream, mainly to cut down on the amount of oral supplements I'm taking.I have been using the cream for almost a year now and my Vitamin D levels have only increased by 15%.I have my own set of issues with my Vit D levels, so I'm rating it 3 stars instead of higher, based on what it has done for me personally.Perhaps if you don't have other things contributing to low Vit D levels it would be more helpful for you.All of that being said, I will continue to use the cream...it's affordable, convenient and slowly but surely helping to raise my Vit D.

My teeth feel much cleaner after I brush with this than when I brush with a manual toothbrush.If two people want to use the brush and switch brush heads, there is not convenient way to store the brush head that you are not using (e.g.This toothbrush simply does a much better job than a manual toothbrush and really gives you that fresh-from-the-dentist clean feeling.Inside the box you will find the toothbrush itself, a charge stand, 2 brush heads (one attached to the toothbrush and a replacement head), and a set of instructions.The toothbrush does not come pre-charged and the instruction manual recommends a 16-hour charge cycle, which seems excessive.It feels like the rotating head is really getting into the gumline.What's really nice is that this toothbrush and my other Oral-B both accept the same replaceable brush heads which is great since they usually come in packs of more than one.I recommend this product.I wanted to see if a less expensive electric toothbrush, if it was comparable to the more expensive electric toothrushes, like the one I have been using for years now, and have been very satisfied with.This electric toothbrush doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a more expensive electric toothbrush, such as the ability to choose from more than one setting, or a UV sanitizer.I have to say tho that this electric toothbrush made my teeth feel like they were really being scrubbed, so when I was finished using it, my teeth felt very clean.

This product doesn't have any odor really to speak of so I do role a fragrant deodorant over the top of it that I bought on etsy.So the trip I've  used is to rub two fingers on the surface of the deodorant, my index and middle finger, until the friction causes the deodorant to warm up a little, which makes it easier to come off.It sounds a little gross I guess, but it really isn't bad....it just feels like grainy lotion.The new formula, with the probiotics, is a little easier to rub on directly to your skin, but unfortunately, it is more 'crumbly' and a lot of it crumbles off when I do that.So even with the new formula, I still use my fingers to extract what I need and rub it under my arms.So while I love love love the efficacy of this product, I would like the company to keep improving and refining their product until they have tweaked it enough to address the previously mentioned concerns.I tried this deodorant because it is made in a warm climate where it no doubt has to work hard to protect people there.

One of my 1st toys (and very 1st with an anal stimulator, very scary *L*).A good introducer because it has all the right things with the clitoral vibrator to set the mood, the anal "probe" is very small, smaller than a finger, so it's not too invasive, and I think this one has a vibrator as well.Overall a very stimulating toy.The only con I can really think of with this toy was that the main shaft was maybe a little too firm for all the added ridges/details they put into it.With too much friction it could be painful, and for those not very experienced it could be considered a little girthy for something so ridged as well (also causing some friction pain).Clitoral stimulator is of average power, but the overall vibrator is on the weaker side.

While the Norelco rotaries require cleaning after every shave (and sometimes halfway through a shave if your beard is thick enough or the cutting efficiency drops like a rock) unless you have very short whiskers, the Remington can hold several shavings worth of clippings because the space is so large beneath the razor heads.-Cleaning is easier in that you can clean the razor heads under running water instead of taking the heads apart.What this does is make for much better and closer cutting along the jaw line and the chin areas, while still performing fairly well on broad areas like the cheeks and neck (though not as well as the Remington if you have fairly flat cheeks).So while the Norelco doesn't do as good of a job on those areas as the Remington does, it is far superior to the Remington on the chin and jaw areas.The best of both worlds would be to incorporate the two concepts together, with the entire head mount tilting like it does with the Remington and yet having the individual heads and their individual platforms to independently tilt to allow for better and closer coverage of angular areas like the chin and jaw areas.The Remington is closer to achieving this since it has the broad head platform already floating and the heads floating within that broad head platform.I had to press harder and shave longer to get near the quality of shave I did with the Braun Pulsonic; which is so fine tuned, one need not press the razor into the skin at all and still it gets closer and a better shave.LOLCons - Plug blades do not flip recess for travel (minor), no stand (I use the one that came with the Norelco), the pop up shaver flips open and requires two hands or greater dexterity to close than the Norelco that opened and shut with the slide/button one finger action and because the slide/button does not "keep" it open it is a bit whimpier to use in comparison.After using it for a couple of months I used my old Norelco on a whim (battery pretty much dead) and found I loved both the feel/action of the Norelco and the result far better than the Remington and ended up buying a refurbished unit of my old one.While the Remington is not a bad razor, it simply does not do as good a job as my old Norelco, nor does it feel as effective while actually shaving so it has been relegated to the draw of no return.Once you get your technique down, it's a relatively quick shave (maybe like 3 minutes)2) The `time left' indicator is a good feature, letting you know how many minutes of charge are left.3) The flip-top on the head of the shaver makes it pretty easy to clean - everyday stubble actually comes out as almost fine, dustlike shavings, when I shook the razor out.4) Convenience - since the shavings pretty much end up inside the flip top, this would probably be a good shaver to keep at the office, or for travel - it gets the job done without making a mess.Cons:1) It didn't seem to handle my sideburns and moustache area well.

I think most of the reviews here with hyped adjectives are from the person promoting this product.Think about this..A neurologist would hear from his patients in droves all over the world if this stuff worked for the MAJORITY, but sadly they don't hear that.If it worked as claimed for the MAJORITY DON'T YOU THINK DOCTORS WOULD RECOMMEND IT, OR DO YOU THINK EVERY DOCTOR HAS A HIDDEN AGENDA?If you think that then you are wrong..neurologists have TONS of patients that would love to bring them some relief just for the referrals alone..doctors aren't that heartless.. Sure, this stuff may help a few, but the body does amazingly healing itself also, so some are going to gain relief just from their own body finally healing itself..that's what the con artists of this product are hoping for..remember, YOUR doctor would know if it worked, ask him, ask a few.Notice someone said if you leave a positive review you will be given a gift..another red flag..it you click on their site and try to leave they will stop you and tell you they will give you a free bottle..may as well at 70 bucks a bottle I would too.Thats because the stuff cost pennys a bottle to produce..Trust me, if the free bottle doesn't work, DON'T be conned into them telling you you may have to take it for 4 months or so.

However an article on life extension's website mentions the science behind using this for prostate problems.The article I read said the following:"Investigators examined the effects of milk thistle components against hormone-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells and hormone-independent PC3 cells.Isosilybin B and its mirror-image isomer, isosilybin A, reduced PSA secretion, while other milk thistle constituents did not show this activity.1 The effect of isosilybins A and B on PSA is particularly noteworthy, as emerging evidence suggests PSA itself may play a role in prostate cancer's progression and metastasis.2-4 (See "Does PSA Promote Prostate Cancer?"".......................................................................This is the only Milk Thistle supplement that I am aware of that is standardized to contain all the correct constituents of milk thistle to obtain the desired effect.I only take milk thistle 3-4 x a week.I've used LEF's Milk Thistle for years, nothing can compare to this product, NOTHING.

Like others, I buy this toothpaste for the tube design- because it stands upright, there is absolutely NO mess with this tube.I want the tingle and the &#34;just brushed&#34; mintiness.The only issue with this tube design is that it's VERY hard to get the last bits of toothpaste out of the tube when you are starting to run out.Because it's stored upright, the toothpaste migrates to the bottom of the tube and is therefore tricky to squeeze out.This is not a tube designed for those with joint problems, because once the toothpaste begins to run out, you pretty much have to squeeze it with a vice to get more out, even though is quite a bit left in the tube.Another reviewer mentioned running a tiny bit of water into the tube, and I tried that, and it actually worked really well- I got at least another week's use out of it.So if you are looking for minty fresh toothpaste that won't get all over your counter, this is the way to go.the tube is a little hard to squeeze out.

This combination produces an exquisite shaving brush that quickly and softly massages the face with lather; resulting in a well saturated whisker prepared for a good close shave.A well crafted badger brush will last a life time if treated well.This brush is beautiful, comes in a nice case, that I don't use now that the brush hangs on its stand.I confess that I had issue building a lather the first few days, but that was really due to the fact that this brush can hold so much more water than my old badger brush, I was actually diluting my own lather.Once I figured the ratio in the new brush, the lather is amazing, I can easily get enough lather for my 3 passes and one touch up/buffing pass.This is a really nice brush, yes it is a tad on the expensive side, but you could spend the same or more on an Art Of Shaving brush without the classiness or history.(still worth popping in your wish list :-), who knows maybe someone else will buy it for you)If you just want a good silvertip brush and really don't care if its traditional styling, handmade or any of those type issues, then there are plenty of really nice silver tip brushes that are a lot less expensive.

dosage is two caplets a day it is an easy to swallow vitamin, and the price was good, so I bought, there was no side effects For me, I have been taking Calcium, Magnesium and Zinc combo caplets for years.Brought it home and read the back label and to my happy surprise noticed that it ALSO has (in 3 caps) 600 IU of vitamin D3.The amount supplied of Vitamin D3 is low (not a daily requirement) it is enough because it is needed to get the Calcium to work.There is also a Natures Bounty Calcium with Vitamin D that has more vitamin D. For me, I need extra magnesium as it helps me sleep.What I use these caps for:1) Sleep Aid - Thirty minutes before bedtime I take 3 of these and also take Valerian.Then I sleep well.2) Also, I take two caps at lunch for extra calcium and magnesium zinc etc because I find I need extra calcium and magnesium and even zinc.If you are looking for a great quality Calcium and Magnesium and Zinc dosage, look no more, you have found it.Highly recommend this!I really like this product - it provides the best combination and dosage of calcium  with D3 for improved absorption, zinc and magnesium for bone strength (calcium), muscle repair (magnesium), and general healing (zinc) with small tablets even though you have to take 3, at a very reasonable price.As you can see, these are not the most bio-available or absorbable forms of these minerals:&#10004;Calcium:  1000 mg, as Calcium Carbonate and Calcium Gluconate.&#10004;Magnesium: 400 mg, as Magnesium Oxide and Magnesium Gluconate.&#10004;Zinc:  25 mg, as Zinc Gluconate and Zink Citrate.Also included:&#10004;Vitamin D3: 600 IU, as Cholecalciferol.&#10004;Sodium:  10 mg.I would recommend taking extra vitamin D3 in the morning and Magnesium of better grade in the evening in addition to these pills.That said, if you are taking calcium-magnesium-zinc preventively, this is actually a pretty good deal.

It is taking me a little time to get used to it as I always used the concentrated formulas and I guess I feel that I need to use a little bit more of the product to get the results that I was used to.mom buys concentrate but i received a bit of this and really i think it is not as &#34;bubbly&#34; as the concentrate but it does the job.It is very effective in cleaning heavily encrusted dishes with ease.One doesn't have to use a lot of the detergent to complete the job.Dawn removes grease stains on clothes, cleans my shower, kills fleas on my pups (don't panic - used very limited for this purpose - some folks freak out and think it's dog murder to wash them in anything but expensive stuff - makes a fast flea killer for the short term high need times), and hey - gets my dishes clean too!

I am returning this product ASAP because it has too many problems.First of all, my doctor took my blood pressure manually - the old fashined way and it was very normal - excellent infact.Cuff stays inflated - having to squeeze the air out of it with my two hands2.During the measurment, the cuff continues to tighten beyond what is needed - causing more pain than necessary.3.At times the cuff losens then tightens back down again.This is not a reliable product and I can not recomend it.First I bought the Omron model with the regular cuff and that cuff was too small, kept getting error messages, bought this Lifesource one and the cuff was too big, kept getting error messages, so I finally bought a wrist model (omron) and has been working great, tested the wrist model at the doctors office and even though no two readings would ever be exactly the same, according to the doctor, he was confident that the readings were well within the range of accuracy.

My wife has tried several different products, including Prep H.  She says that TRONOLANE ointment works the best by far.The Mayinglong Musk was used twice per day for 3 days after the Tronolane got the pain and itch under control.The Tronolane probably blocks the Mayinglong Musk from working if you are trying to mix them, because the Tronolane has Zinc Oxide which really coats and creates a barrier the Mayinglong Musk couldn't penetrate.I found that after several days with Tronolane I was able to switch to the Mayinglong Musk and it did help speed up the healing process!To me, Tronolane addressed the symptoms and the Mayinglong Musk helped you to heal faster.Tronolane is excellent and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.

I just went through a bad head cold and cough with congestion and this did NOTHING, I repeat NOTHING to help any of these symptoms.I was able to cough up and blow out more mucus.Phenylephrine shrinks the vessels in the nasal passages to relieve nasal congestion and it will also help with "blocked" ears.All in all this is a decent medicine to give you some relief, but it is by no means the strongest otc cold med and I wouldn't use it for a really bad cough or "severe" congestion as the label says since there are other meds which are a bit more potent, work better and are cheaper.Oh, and the taste - I think it is supposed to be sort of berry flavored, but it definitely has that typical cough medicine taste that makes you want to gag it back up.I'm battling a nasty cold as I write this, and was able to really put this stuff to the test last night when my cough was keeping me awake and making me miserable.In the past, my preferred cough remedies have beenRobitussin DMandDelsym.Delsym is expensive, works all night long, is highly recommended by many doctors and pharmacists, and tastes surprisingly good.I took a dose of Mucinex Fast-Max Severe Congestion & Cough last night.

I've been taking the Jarrow Red Yeast Rice with CoQ10 and had some surprisingly good cholesterol numbers on my last doctor's visit.There is no wheat, no gluten, no soybeans, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts, or tree nuts in the product.For me, I usually take CoQ10 along with the red yeast rice, as I believe in studies regarding the benefits of CoQ10, and that red yeast rice can deplete the muscle enzyme CoQ10.I usually take a Jarrow Formulas product which contains the red yeast rice and CoQ10 and a separate natto capsule, so in switching to this product, I still end up taking three capsules, only here the red yeast rice and natto are combined and I take a separate CoQ10.I think its a matter of preference in what combination you take these supplements, and I am not a doctor nor can I offer health care advice, but I think most conventional wisdom is to take CoQ10 if you are taking red yeast rice.Jarrow Red Yeast Rice Plus Nattokinase Capsules are a health supplement.I've been taking Natto and Red Yeast Rice separately, for the cardiovascular benefits.If you are looking for a Red Yeast Rice and Nattokinase supplement then this is the product for you.

Having owned this shaver for about a month now, I have to say it is very good.The shaver is very quiet and it tends to cut pretty close.The shaver cannot be used while it is charging since its sitting in the base against a wall outlet.2.You must plug the charger into the upper outlet on a receptacle to avoid obstructing access to the lower receptacle on your wall outlet.Personally, I do not find this to be a huge deal, but I do prefer the convenience of being able to use a shaver on a corded charger in case I need to shave when the shaver battery is dead.Overall, I really like this shaver and its well worth the price.They said it has worked fine and does a good job so far $30 for an electric shaver is a bargain - it's easy to spend $100 or more.I love the wet shaving feature which I find considerably better than dry shaving.My only gripe is that the charger isn't very sensibly designed - it mounts the shaver directly into the socket.

Lets say my sleep pattern is 10 pm every night well if I go to bed at 1 am on a weekend because im out late well then my sleep pattern is thrown out of wack and I have a hard time falling asleep the next few nights, my mind races and I get frustrated just laying there.Well not with these pills, they do take 3 days to work really effectively but they DO work, they calm my mind and allow me to really relax and I just fall asleep and STAY asleep, I dont wake up at 3:30 am wide awake (which im usually prone to) but best of all for me once im on a great sleep balance I dont have to take the pills until I mess up my sleep pattern again, these would be great for those who work crazy shifts and cant really have a regular sleep pattern.For some reason on some nights I go to bed 10 PM, and awaken at 2 AM or so and find it difficult to go back to sleep easily - it may take 2 - 3 hours to get back to sleep; this seems to happen perhaps one in five nights.I still wake up during the night but really tired and get back to sleep quickly.i used to take 4 prescription meds just to be able to fall asleep and hopefully stay asleep.i am only taking one prescription now that is for anxiety and sleep plus this Deep Sleep.

I bought these hoping they would be a decent product (like so many of the other seventh generation products) that could help cut down on our wasteful use of toilet paper.I'd use this paper in a pinch (sorry, couldn't resist the pun) but I have often gone out of my way to avoid buying it.Even though the rolls have more sheets than Green Forest, I end up using more paper because this paper is: thinner, rougher and less absorbent.This time the toilet paper was a lesser quality.There will be HUGE MONEY to be made for the first company who figures out how to make an earth friendly but soft toilet paper.

The batteries are being used in a camera that is known to use batteries quick and fast.I use my camera a fair amount to make video records of my hiking excursions with the beagle for my blog, among other things.I have not used the AAA batteries at all, so this review is oriented toward the AA batteries contained in the package along with the package of AA batteries I later purchased to supplement those that came with the charger.Believe it or not, there are a bunch of people who spend a lot of time with very expensive chargers and very expensive batteries that claim this charger and these batteries are not "good enough".One is that it can only charge batteries in pairs.Because you get batteries with this, the actual charger cost is very cheap, albeit with the cheap negative terminal.I only gave this 4 stars because of the terminal and because it doesn't charge old alkalines like some other chargers do.One disturbing sign is that: Rayovac previously claims Hybrid can be recharged "up to 500 times", but the new Platinum is advertised on Rayovac web site as just "275 times".As of this writing, the price of this Rayovac package (PS33 charger + 2 each of Platinum LSD AA and AAA cells) is actually cheaper than buying4x Rayovac Platinum LSD AA cells, so it is still a good value because the charger is essentially thrown in for free.

I have had this trimmer for about 8 months now and have no complaints, I haven't even cleaned it and it still works like a charm.At the price I paid for it, i could buy one a couple of times a year and not feel bad about it.I like this ergonomic ease of use; weeding my nose hair garden, formerly one of my most tedious grooming tasks, is now simple.The blade guard, which appears to be made of the same metal as the blade, vibrates somewhat when I use it, which I think causes my skin irritation.This Remington Trimmer is very similar, except it has a wide blade (about like the one on Finishing Touch) on one side of the head and a narrow blade on the other side.Between the two trimmers, Finishing Touch is a little more gentle, but it's not nearly as quick as the Remington.Years later, I bought one for the same reason; undesirable nose hairs.The trimmer works exactly as described and I'm very satisfied with the product.

Since the batteries were a waste and a hassle for something I don't use everyday, I chose this one because it has a cord to plug in.I bought this for bed sheets as an upgrade for the smaller cheaper most common one on Amazon.It seems to work just fine but the cord is too short to reach across a queen size bed, that's my only complaint.The process of cleaning a bed sheet takes some time, I would say 30 minutes for a fitted sheet and the sheet between the comforter and bed.I just make circles and am very patient.Cheaper than buying new sheet sets so I'm happy so far.I've only used it on thicker sweaters so not sure if it works on thin sweaters, but overall I'm so happy with this purchase, it was well worth the cost.It has worked like a charm, easy to clean up and love the fact I can plug it into an outlet and not worry about batteries.

Two weeks ago I didn't have any pre-existing prostate conditions, and after taking Prostate 5lx, I still don't.The largest study, conducted in 2006 with 225 men, found no improvement in prostate health for men taking Saw Palmetto over that of men taking the placebo.So now he has stopped taking them.The regimen of supplements that Roger Mason recommends can get very expensive, so this product Prostate 5 LX may be a great alternative to what my husband is taking for younger men without any symptoms.So only time will tell if this product or any natural product is working, but at least you would be doing something to keep the prostate healthy.Summary:  Nutritional supplements and anything with a health claim are hard to judge or evaluate, but if you are already taking a saw palmetto supplement, this is a good option.This supplement has several key ingredients which are thought to improve prostate health and reduce inflammation in general.

Even if I have been eating very close to bedtime, one Zantac 75 tablet is all I need to give me peace of mind.Zantac 75 is also effective for eliminating heartburn and acid indigestion after the symptoms have already made themselves known.If I experience a small amount of stomach pain from overeating, Zantac 75 has no problem attacking the acid and eliminating the pain.But if acid reflux is the problem, Zantac 75 takes a little longer to get the job done.The packaging keeps each individual tablet safe, dry, and ready for use.Overall, Zantac 75 is a very good acid reducer that functions best when used as a preventative medicine to stop stomach acid buildup before it gets out of hand.I am extremely please and will buy more due the quality of the product I love this medicine for my stomach and it's really helps and the price for it is a great bargain and will order it again and service is great on delivery :) I only take Zantac during pregnancy since I only get heartburn during that time.

I found it difficult to shave using an electric shaver for a long time, as the shaver normally gets hot and razor burns get too much to bear.The Philips Norelco 8040X shaving system is the first electric shaver I've used.There are a couple of things I was concerned aboutHow close of a shave could I get from an electric shaver?Will the razor or shaving conditioner irritate my skin?Will I be able to take it in the Shower?How well does it travel?After using this razor for a couple of days, I have to say that its a GREAT electric shaver.Let me tell you why:ComfortablePretty close shave including neck (not as close as a razor but I figure everyone would know this)CordlessThe shaving head is flexible to fit the contour of your face and neck.Able to shave in the shower.Here are some of the things to watch for with this razor:This is a very comfortable razor so be careful of how much pressure you put on the razor while you shave if you have sensitive skin.Test the shaving conditioner first to make sure it will not break you okay if you have sensitive skin.It would be nice if I could have used another shaving conditioner.There is no way to plug the cord directly into the shaver, meaning that if you travel you need to bring the cheap base along with you as well.Pretty Quiet.Bottom Line, if you're in the market for an electric shaver, this is a good one to start with.So then I went back to the razor which has been giving me a close shave that lasts the day.This shaving system did not make my skin red (I do believe the moisturizing system works), and gave a good shave, but by the afternoon (initial shave around 5 AM) I had to use the shaver again.

Thats what some blood pressure pills were found to have in them that were rip off pills coming into the United States from China... those being sold supposedly on the black market were actually making their way into Walgreens and CVS's across America.I know there's lots of other glowing reviews on here, but from my own personal experience, this stuff is scary.I didn't want to take prescription antidepressants, so I figured I would try something "natural".The directions say you can take up to two pills a day, but no way was I taking a second one that day.The next day, I decided to take another one (with food) and it was the exact same process: shortness of breath for about 10 minutes, and then feeling wired and strange the rest of the day.I continued taking this stuff for a week (1 pill a day) thinking that maybe I just needed to get used to it, but on the last day that I took this, I felt so wired/edgy/dissociated that it scared me and I haven't taken anymore of this stuff since.I would also like to add that I was on no other medications while taking this and hadn't been on any medication in months, so there's no way this bad reaction was from mixing medications.I suggest you do a lot of research on 5-HTP before taking this stuff.

I would prefer something that tastes tolerable over something that my child would drink by the bottle anyway because the last thing you would want is for your child to get a hold of the medicine bottle and drink it like candy.The first couple of times my little guy wasn't thrilled about the taste and fought me a bit, but by the third try he took it just fine.In most European countries products containing artificial dyes require a warning label so why would you want any of that in something you give your child?Also, don't be fooled by the word "infant's" because the acetaminophen dose in this product is the same as it is in anything labeled "children's".My baby seems to like the taste.I've used this brand since he was a newborn and he is a little over a year now.I thought when I was first researching acetaminophen products that HFCS was listed as an ingredient for Little Fevers, but maybe it has been removed (perhaps when all the infant pain relievers were reformulated and dosing changed about a year ago).We have tried Cherry and he didn't like that either so it may just be a picky baby or it might be that it doesn't taste well??

Having used this CALM for 2 months, I developed problems in rectum area because of the laxative effect on me everyday.But it held leg cramps at bay during the use.That is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1.I replaced this item with Mono Magnesium Malate by MgBright( more expensive but worth it) that works without laxative effects.Yet, I don't take Monomagnesium Malate for everyday use, because I don't trust any and all supplement's side effects.I keep Monomagnesium Malate handy just for the occasion when any part of my muscles (in hand or legs or foot) starts hick ups.If I take one capsule of it with a meal and a lot of water, the muscles would calm down provided that my body is not chilled.Once cramps attack you when your muscles are chilled, magnesium supplements will not have power.When cramps already started, take Armish remedy instead of Quinine.Armish remedy on leg cramps is a lot safer and gentle to our body.If I am home, I  heat my drinking water.And take Mono Magnesium Malate when your muscles start to make hick ups before a full fledged leg cramps start.I eat a lot of cooked spinach everyday to supply my body with nature's magnesium.I also eat a lot of nuts that I mix.The reason that magnesium helps prevent muscle cramps is that magnesium relaxes muscles while calcium tightens.But the main causes are chill and dehydration.

One nice thing about these colors is that the plastic LED window is also the same color as the band itself, which means that the LED will appear in the color of the band.Size wise, they're exactly the same dimensions as the ones you get from the Flex band as well, so no surprises there.One gripe I had with this is the fact that even though you pay $30, you only really get one plastic &#34;clasp&#34;.The band that came with my Fitbit is the slate color and I've been wearing it 24/7 since early January so it's nice to have some other colors to change off with.These bands come with a single interchangeable clasp that's like the one that came with the original band.I've never had a problem with the band coming off, even when pulling tight sleeves over it or with the dog's leash wrapped around the wrist with the band on it.The navy blue band is my favorite and the little lights in the display show up blue instead of white like on my slate colored band.

The Gaia Herbs Sleep & Relax Herbal Tea is the first food product that I have reviewed for Gaia.According to the box, which contains fifty single-serve packets of tea, Sleep & Relax Herbal Tea is produced in Tuscany, Italy by Aboca, which partnered with Gaia Herbs.The difference, however, between the two teas is that Gaia seems to have a more abundance of natural herbs in their tea than Celestial Seasonings.I highly recommend the Gaia Herbs Sleep & Relax Herbal Tea for those who have difficulty falling asleep.Happy Sleepy Times ahead :) This tea puts me in a palpably relaxed state and helps me sleep like no other tea I've tried, and I'm guessing this is due to the Passion Flower.I've given this Gaia Herbs Sleep & Relax tea a four out of five star rating because, while it works well, I don't particularly like the taste of it.I love tea and I sometimes have trouble sleeping so this tea was just about right for me.You just have to steep it the way you do with any tea.

And not many others.For me, my Philips Norelco beard trimmer has enough setting to keep my facial hair groomed.However I do know people who will find this stubble trimmer useful.As others have pointed out, Norelco has repackaged a facial hair trimmer as a stubble trimmer with various settings that determine the length of one's facial hair.The other settings are too long and are more for trimming bears and sideburns.Essentially it's a clipper that has a swiveling guard that you can rotate to adjust the length it will cut to.After using a high-end Braun or Norelco shaver this feel like a cheap toy.When I first got this stubble trimmer it held a charge for weeks.

I had heard about Raspberry Ketones and how they are supposed to really help with weight loss.I like these because they don't cause heartburn ( I tried other brands that do).They curb my appetite, and I have lost about 10 pounds since taking them (I've been on them for about 5 months).However, I am dieting, so I can't be 100% sure that the raspberry ketones are responsible for the weight loss.I am not too familiar with DalVia Labs (the maker of this product).I've been using Dalvia's Raspberry Ketone drops and really like them but I decided to order the capsules so I could add them to my vitamin/pill case for when I go out of town.I jog every other morning and hit the gym those days I don't, I haven't seen results like these from a natural supplement and i'm looking forward to losing even more weight for the summer!I've been taking 2 Raspberry Ketones capsules every day (One with each meal) and have noticed a great decline in my appetite.

Not a big fan of these types of support for knee ... it seems like a full compression type sleeve for the knee does a better job for me in maintaining or reducing workout stress on the knee.I ordered this when I couldn't find myACE Knee Strap, which of course I found about an hour before this Mueller strap arrived at my door.Hands down, the ACE knee strap is my favorite, because the extra features certainly make the nearly doubled price worth it.- The Mueller strap doesn't have a plastic-coated cut-out in the strap in order to facilitate tightening.However, I think it's really worth it to go up a bit to the ACE strap for the features, especially if you really need knee relief.Had I tried out this strap before the ACE strap, I think I would have remained incredulous that such a small item can have a huge effect on my knee discomfort while distance running.

I like that the weight loss is steady and not fast which makes it an healthier way of losing and keeping the weight off.Good way to lose weight but if you are looking for a quick fix then this is not for you, but Weight-Loss Gold does effectively work and I only average about one pound a week.I wasn't sure initially what was causing the change, and upon doing some research, found it had to be due to the Garcinia Mangostana (or Mangosteen) in the Healthy Weight Loss GOLD!I've lost 4 pounds - which isn't earth-shattering, but I've only been taking the product for about a week.The price of these is not cheap, so I would only recommend trying the product if you are working out and want something a little extra to help you with your weight loss goal.Update: After taking this for almost 3 months, I have been losing even more weight.In my case I was already on a diet and exercise program and had lost weight but was no longer losing weight and still needed to lose some.I have been taking this product off and on for about a month and have still lost about 5 pounds.

I was hoping this would be an easy little device for giving quick readings for both pulse and blood oxygen levels.It's also easy to store away in the included case.If there is a downside at all, it's that the replacement battery is a size I've never seen before (1/2 AA) - but I did find them here on Amazon, so even that isn't a huge deal.Overall, I would recommend this if you're looking for a quick and easy way to measure both pulse and blood oxygen levels.A pulse oximeter is a device to measure the level of oxygen being transported in your blood; 95-99% would be normal and much lower than that indicates something is wrong.Slipping a finger into the soft rubber sleeve and within seconds after (firmly) pushing the unmissable button and you'll be reading blood oxygen level and pulse rate in clear, high-contrast numbers.The weirdest thing about it is the use of a battery type I'd never seen before, a "1/2 AA" lithium battery.This is a helpful little device if you're looking for something to tell you your your oxygen level and pulse rate.

I did this the first few days, but after reading more about the thyroid and iodine, I found this website [...] which says that putting iodine on the skin is essentially wasting it to evaporation and doesn't indicate how much iodine you need from how fast it absorbs.I've used a lover strength solution before and it helped my thyroid gland problem, but I feel I need a stronger product.I bought this with every intention of taking it internally, but after looking at it, I chickened out and started using it topically instead, reapplying when the previous application was no longer there.And then, having researched even more about it, I realized tonight that I can still take it internally...I just need to order some empty capsules, and put 1-4 drops in right before I take it.So, having noticed that I feel a little better from just putting it on my skin, I'm looking forward to seeing what happens now.First I did an iodine patch test to see if the iodine would absorb into my skin more quickly than 24 hours (which is what they tell you to do).J.Crow's is the only brand of Lugol's Solution of Iodine which I buy, this and the 2% version.One doctor uses a 7% solution of Iodine for treating skin cancer.

With unregulated supplements like this, I never have any idea whether what I'm getting is good stuff or full of bad stuff, so you have to go on reputation.Jarrow as a brand has a very good reputation, so I thought I'd give these a try.Now I'm back on amazon to order NAC from NOW foods -- because I can actually swallow the capsules.It's not like I'm expecting candy or I need my medicine to be transmitted via gummy bear -- but I really couldn't swallow these things without gagging and spitting up my morning coffee.It helped a little -- but then I had to take twice as many pills.I'm sure this is not a problem for a lot of people -- but it's a huge problem for me.It wasn't the brand, as I tried several different kinds; it was the N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine that just didn't agree with me.

This is supposed to lower blood pressure.I think it works but I am not sure about the long term effects of using it.I tried this product because I have high blood pressure and I was looking for something to clam me down.My blood pressure improved with lower BP values after taking Carditone and I also got swelling ankle as the side effect.After extensive testing my allergist told me that I am only allergic to dust mites and I have been taking shots for few years now.I began the course with one-pill-a-day (took one right after breakfast) for a week, noticed considerable drop in systolic pressure (my average reading was 150/80 measured over a year, after taking Carditone for 3 days the reading went down to 132/72 - measured only twice).I thought I would try this after seeing all of the great reviews and found that it dropped my blood pressure a little, but I started have HORRIBLE headaches as a result and a very spaced out feeling.

If I have to shave fast, I use these in my German-made Gillette safety razor clone.Very nice, smooth shave for me.If you have stubble or have not shaven for a couple days I would recommend using a Merkur blade first then use Shark blade thereafter.This is a sharp blade and irritation and nicks will happen but don't give up on the blade just be more careful, shave slower and shaving is easier and economical with this blade if you shave daily.These are also very outstanding razor blades, they as well provide a nice clean close shave and the price is right for these blades as well..

I also like that it is a wet/dry shaver, and offers around 60 minutes of shaving per charge.The only problem is this shaver costs close to a hundred dollars and offers no closer a shave than the $30 Norelco I had been using.If you want a good shave with a shaver that will also look great on your bathroom counter, you cannot go wrong with this shaver.I kept using it, but today, 6/26/14, the fully charged razor died after 2 minutes of shave causing me to have to get out of the shower wet to grab my Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc4, which is the best electric shaver I have used to date.Luckily my old shaver still had a charge and I used that.This is the second Remington shaver I've tried and in both cases it took longer for me to get a good shave and the shave was never as close as I got with the Norelcos.

There seems to be a lot of lemons out there.THE GOOD++ The unit can be used with the AC adapter connected, which is good since the battery seems to have frequent problems holding a charge++ The unit includes a travel case, which is convenient for storage and transport++ The unit is based on UV technology that, in theory, should produce good results after repeated uses++ Setup is simple (though it does require a small flat head screw driver!)My first unit did not give me a charge indicator, but seemed to have some juice after over-night charging.Even after leaving it connected for more than the 14 hours they recommend, it never fully charged.-- While the unit can be used with the AC adapter, it seems to overheat too quickly.That would not be a problem on its own, but because the unit can only be run for a short period of time it becomes difficult to use effectively-- The unit works best on flat surfaces and cannot be used sideways without triggering the safety shut-off.That makes it difficult to use on furniture and even highly textured bedding and linensCONCLUSIONIf my replacement includes a functioning battery that holds a charge, I will give this another look.

I use Ortho-k contact lenses at night so I cannot have any pressure on my eyes while I sleep.This mask has a nice foam material (inside the lining) which gives a great concave mold so as not to put pressure on the eyes.In general, continued pressure on the eyes is something to avoid so most other sleep masks should be considered as unacceptable to eye health.I would rate this mask 5 stars, but it allows a small amount of light in from the nose area.However, I do recommend this mask over any other standard mask because this mask puts zero pressure on your eyes, and clearly this mask is better than nothing at all.Additionally, the mask is lightweight and does a great job of blocking light from the side (it is longer than other masks I have tried that require a tight fit to block light from the side).Because the mask is thin and long, you can easily turn your head to either side without the mask shifting which is a plus.

I have hardwood floors in my home, and I used this mop to clean a tiny bedroom.The instructions say to wash the mop with water, but that did not work well.What that means is that the mop does indeed do a good job of picking up dirt, however it is a major inconvenience that a pad has such a short usage time.The instructions also mention that you only need to use water with the mop.If you're looking for superior results, then don't use water.The pad was also machine washable, so I gave that a try after I was done with the bedroom.It cleaned nicely, however the texture of the pad took a major beating, which reduced its catching power.In my opinion, if you do intend to use this to clean your home, you're going to need about 4-5 pads which you can swap out when one becomes saturated.You could just buy a Swiffer kit and just use the disposable pads it comes with.The Swiffer allows easy switch out of pads and it is cheaper than buying pads for the MysticMop.

I read some reviews on how good it is but I hated the taste of it.One person said it tasted like shaving cream and I should have believed them.I typically am a fan of Aquafresh toothpaste in general.After using this product for a few days, I am not impressed.The first time I used it, it was tough to press the button to release the paste and ended up getting a good amount onto the sink rather than the toothbrush.If you use shaving gel from similar aerosol cans daily, you know what I'm talking about.It was an okay brushing experience but this stuff FOAMS, A LOT.You definitely need less with this toothpaste gel, but it's really hard to control how much goes on your toothbrush in the first place!By the time I am done brushing, I look like I have rabies because it literally just foams in your mouth.It does leave your mouth feeling minty and clean, but I do not think I would buy again unless they improved the dispensing mechanism and make it a bit less foamy.One has topush the dispenser quite a while before the toothpaste comes out, and then it just smears.What a waste of such an otherwise good product.

No side effects or minor complications.Concerns:*Daily serving size of 3 (three) tablets to reach the 100% DV (Daily Value or recommended daily intake) of vitamins and minerals in one tablet of Centrum.Really, you would think when it says "Men's Formula" that anyone wanting to buy men's vitamins would not think they would be good for pregnant women....just saying...Thhe serving size is 3 tablets which are great for spreading them over 3 meals, would have loved it if they could have been in capsule form but the label listed they were tablets so no surprises there.As long as you take them with food there have been no unpleasant pill "burps" on an empty stomach with just water may be another story though as they have a strong aroma compared to most vitamins we have taken.If you have a problem with seasonal allergies or Chamomile, which is a common relative of ragweed,.The instructions on this don't make it clear whether to take one tablet three times a day or three tablets once a day.I guess if you took all three at once you'd really feel it...The actual content of these vitamins leaves something to be desired, but they do contain a good base if you took the full serving size of three tablets.Three of these a day do include a good amounts of various vitamins and minerals.

I tried it more than three years ago and it made no difference at all on the hard water deposits on my shower doors, either calcium or lime.I followed the instructions to the letter, and used up an entire bottle on two shower doors, but it had no effect.I have used it on rust stains as well as let it soak in a humidifier.After googling how to clean my shower head I found out that the best solution was to let the shower head soak in distilled white vinegar overnight.The vinegar worked and the shower head was as good as new!It did clean up a shower faucet fairly well.

Who knew I'd be paying so much for just mouthwash?Well, I do now that I have tried the generic brands.I do brush my teeth with toothpaste right after breakfast but generally, I like to use the mouthwash when I first wake up, and I know that Listerine is one of the best brands to kill those germs in your mouth.He always used the original listerine which can drop you to the ground.This is much better flavor to swish around your mouth with the same results.Great price too!My teeth feel smooth having brushed and done a thirty-second or so rinse with the Listerine Freshburst - very nice.I don't always stock up on mouthwash, but when I get some and notice the first rinse has a little more burn than subsequent rinses, it reminds me just how dirty a mouth can be without it.I recommend Listerine Freshburst as an effective, inoffensively-flavored mouth rinse which is targeted both to reduce plaque and gingivitis.Since Listerine kills germs by direct contact, you want to get the product into the gum pockets to cleanse them - so use your toothbrush!3.Use a flavor of Listerine that is of your liking.kone Not much to say...I like the flavour.

So if you have a moderate activity goal you really want to meet, creeping into the vigorous range is actually bad for your ability to hit your goal.If you have a Bodymedia Core armband, having this display is certainly a lot better than not having it, because there's no other way to get ongoing feedback that doesn't involve constantly taking off the armband to plug it in.If you don't have an armband yet and you want one, you're probably better off waiting for the newer version (and maybe buying a cheaper product to use in the meantime that counts steps to get yourself started.)To do that you have push the button on the armband and one on the display.The noise bothered me- excitedly the first night, I rolled over to see how many calories I had, had to turn on the light (loud beep) sync it (Loud Beep) and then to check calories (Loud Beep) and then my husband woke up and I realized it wasn't really worth the money for me.I didn't like how it always was out of sync, and how I needed to put it really close to the armband and then sync it... then try and get the tiny clasp to pinch my clothing in a near enough spot so that it stayed synced.I wanted to like this item, but as far as luxury items goes, it's kind of inconvenient.The arm band is great but you are better of with a heart rate monitor that shows calories burn ifyou are like me and can't wait to get to the computer.

There seems to be some debate as to how much is the ideal amount for health benefits, between 2000-5000mg for fish oil and 20-100mg for CoQ10, so you will have to make that call based on your own research and how you feel.I actually like the flavor and there is not even a hit of fish and no fishy burping after like you have with some other supplements.If so, you know that they are very enthusiastic about fish oil.One minor annoyance with taking fish oil supplement is the odor.I like this product and like the way the supplement is packaged in little packets.Two packs, which are considered a daily serving, of Choromega Healthy Heart Omega-3 and Coenzyme Q10 supplement meet the new fish oil requirement.We prefer to swallow two packs of this new tasty orange-flavored product to taking four big gelcaps of fish oil.Getting fish oil to taste like anything remotely palatable probably took quite a bit of work.

I heard lack of vitamin B can cause those things, and that taking Super B-Complex would help decrease my anxiety as well as give me more energy.And not only that, but in December I had gotten my first kidney stone (easily the worst pain I've had in life, and I've had lots if painful experiences), and I heard vitamin B is also good for your kidneys.First of all, I was completely unaware of the horrible smell/taste of vitamin B. I thought maybe it was just the Nature Made brand that was like that, but I hear it's just vitamin B in general.And as for the taste, yes I do swallow these as I'm supposed to, but they still leave a nasty taste in the back of my throat, and I also occasionally burp these pills within the first hour of taking them, which brings the taste back.I've been taking these for about 3 weeks, and I can't say I've noticed any improvements.However, I haven't gotten any more kidney stones since I started taking these, so I'll probably keep taking them for that alone, as I'm terrified of getting another stone (those who have had them know what I'm talking about).

FAR FROM IT.The label on this sweetener is deliberately written to confuse the reader - if the actual percentages of erythritol and stevia were openly disclosed to consumers, fewer would buy it.Yes, erythritol does in fact occur naturally in many fruits, but it occurs there in such microscopically small amounts, that it's completely impractical to obtain it from any "natural" sources.This product is manufactured right here in the U.S. using stevia leaves imported from Brazil, and erythritol added as a cheap filler.Looking for pure, non-GMO, certified organic stevia and nothing else?

It works fine on softer skin areas but not effective on the bottom of foot (plantar Warts).I got the Freeze Away and that was more effective.I am a runner and i had to use the freeze away more often than prescribed to get rid of the wart.This worked fine on a friend who had a wart on her hand, very effective.Well, they didn't stick well and she found them to be too small for the area she needed to treat.Nonetheless she tried them and found they made no difference so we went back to he Compound W gel which at least seemed to be helping bring the wart to the surface.

Don't buy this as your first razor to learn DE shaving with, but once you have some basic skills mastered and want to take your shave to the next level, this one waits for you.As much as I enjoy shaving now, its still nice to get it right the first time.I have one small area on my neck that has been an issue for me regardless of razor or technique.I decided to get the 2013 Muhle R41 despite it's reputation of being very aggressive.My reasoning was that a barber uses the same strait razor regardless of the customer's beard.My leap of faith was that with proper technique, the amount of exposed blade and size of blade gap shouldn't matter.I'm sure some of you are laughing at this but it still makes sense to me.However the first shave made me think I had made a grave error, no major cuts but lots of weapers.I concluded this was due to my lazy technique,the Muhle R89 my previous razor is so forgiving one can get away with nearly anything.I went back to my study of proper technique and shaved again the next day with far better results.I just made sure I keep the very shallow angle and head pressure light as a feather.It's gotten better ever since and the R41 is now my daily razor no nicks or weapers.Very close shaves with two passes WTG and a mix of XTG/ATG.This is a great razor but probably not for a total beginner.This razor gives me the best shave ever.So, this really can shave as close as a straight razor can, that's if you know how to use a DE razor.

I wouldn't recommend this sleep mask at all, not for anyone with any intended use for it!For one thing, and this is enough reason not to buy it, IT BROKE IMMEDIATELY!!!No one wants this feeling from mask such as this, I would expect.In addition to pressing in on the eyelids, which I haven't had ANY other mask do like this (and I've tried many), it has the more common problem of pressing on my eyelashes, which I experience as uncomfortable as well.Further, it does NOT block out light or vision, and the nose flap mentioned above is useless in this endeavor.If not for one reason, then for another, this mask is useless.In fairness, I'll note that I've found that that most, perhaps all that I've tried, of low-cost sleep masks such as this one allow for light and vision below the eyes, are uncomfortable, and are ultimately not useful at all to me.I bought a number of different sleep masks at the same time in an effort to find even one that'd work well in blocking out light while not feeling uncomfortable, and I thought this was cheap enough to warrant a shot at it.

However, I'm a little confused about the calories in the three caplets: Pine Nuts have calories, and it looks like these caplets are filled with oil (I assume from those pine nuts).That wouldn't be good...[Update 6Feb2013] The bottle actually lists 3 caplets as having 27 calories, or 9 calories each.Maybe I should just be eating a teaspoon of pine nuts... [End Update] I do notice a decrease in my appetite when I take it, especially if I take 3 in the morning and 3 in the afternoon.Most of us that are carrying too much weight are eating even when we aren't hungry; we eat due to stress, or due to social events, or a myriad of other reasons that have nothing to do with food.I use 2 bottles a month, so even at LE Super Sale price it is `money out the window' if I don't change my diet.When I do go off of sweets I can control my food intake for awhile (since sugar is no longer greatly stimulating it), but all my life, even when eating a healthy diet long-term, I just never feel a quelling of my appetite, so in order to stay thin I spent years leaving the table hungry (even though I ate a full meal).

I haven't owned a electric shaver in decades so I thought I would give it a try with all the new technology,  it has been reviewed as the sharpest shave on the market.Not a bad shaver, fits the hand well, but does not shave as close as the Braun 360 razor I have, but a good razor.I used it with shaving cream for the first two weeks, so that my skin would get used to the razor.Nothing can quite match a straight blade, but this is without a doubt the closest shave I've ever gotten from an electric shaver -- and I'm sure it will produce even better results as my skin and beard "adjust.Shaves as close as any shaver I've used in the past.

This wider Glide floss is a definite improvement over typical Glide string floss though.I used to have to use those floss needles on some of my teeth to be able to get the floss in/out of the spaces.Not so....it does clean your teeth, but it's hard to hold onto and it felt like it bunched up between my teeth, making it harder to floss than normal.The purpose of ribbon style is to be thinner and wider than regular floss going between your teeth.My two beloved brands - Oral B and GLIDE - failed me this time.The floss is too thick, maybe because of the mint flavor - and it didn't easily slide through my teeth like my regular silver canister of GLIDE does.I so wanted to love this floss, too.In other news, I also recently got a new REACH floss product - a very flexible sticky taps floss stuff that actually fits in through my teeth - you might want to check that product out as well, too.Bottom line - the coating that gives this floss a nice flavor, prevents the slick slippery gliding action I've come to expect.

People need to realize this is not Yohimbine so the dosage will not be the same so if you decided to take 6caps of this like you would of yohimbe(depending on your body weight) then YES you may die,because you took something without doing the proper research, which is just being stupid.Research any and every product you put into your body, don't just take something and then get mad of the outcome.This product has yohimbine in it but only a small percentage per pill.Also here is a website that breaks it down very well and you can figure how much you should take :  [...]Not everybody can take any form of yohimbe/yohimbine they will get a bad reaction to it.So always take one pill and see how your body response then over time increase your dosage to where you need it to be.Just do your research and don't shout out the product almost kill me, when you don't even know how to take the product.

It's not a fake-smelling orange scent.It reminds me of the orange oil that you would buy for conditioning wood furniture- like what orange rinds smell like.I am very happy with this essential oil, and this product range/brand in general.First some prelude on my background: I do not consider myself an essential oil expert, although I have had an active interest in (and made regular use of) aromatherapy and essential oils for over 20 years.I don't have other sweet orange oils to compare this with, so I can only write about it on its own merits.My email contact with the owner of this brand has me satisfied that he knows what he's doing and that these products are as pure as he says.I mostly use this oil for cooking, specifically for chocolate production.It also adds a nice touch to cream of pumpkin soap.Having tried the Cinnamon and Sweet Orange oil, I have now ordered quite a number of Plant Therapy Essential Oils.It should be noted that some essential oils can create or provoke sensitivity in the user if used in an undiluted form on the skin.Taste  yummy and great price for  organic This orange oil doesn't smell as my last bottle of another brand, but it's nice and I appreciate the size.

I have started to use the hypertonic rinse, which I've found to be more effective than the isotonic.Actually, what I do now is a hypertonic rinse followed by an isotonic.I use the Hypertonic packets daily, once each morning.When I use these it almost feels like when you're in a swimming pool and you get water up your nose!I like the Hypertonic solution better than the regular strength.

However, both the razor and the refillable blades are a bit pricey.This is a good razor like many others.Even if you have problems turning your wrist don't get this razor because it won't help and only tear your face up.And the razor itself rests on a ball; this is so it will adjust to the contours of one's face for a closer shave.Allow me to tell you what I found after using this razor about four or five times; the razors become very dull, the lubrication strip is mediocre at best (have had better, have had worse), the "flexball" is really sort of a joke since it seemed like the razor was working against me.The ribbed handle for a controlled shave is a bit funny; unless a person has a condition where their hands shake uncontrollably I don't see how any man is going to have any razor slip out of his grip.To be fair, I did feel like had a nice clean shave with a smooth face after I used this razor.

Great to add to smoothie.This doesn't stick to my mouth like all the other Spirulina products I've tried.Source Naturals may not rate as high as Earthrise or the Hawaiian Spirulina powders on the market but this is good organic Spirulina powder in a child-resistant hard plastic bottle.I encourage people to use superfoods like Spirulina to maintain or reclaim their health and this product is a good value.Been using this spirulina for a month now and yes it taste harsh but the health benefits are well worth it,i tried drinking it with just water and it was quite hard to drink but i drank it anyway.There are several was to use it and i found putting a teaspoon in a juice recipe makes it taste delicious so here is one of the recipe you can usePut 2 pears1 and a half oz/40g young spinach4 sprigs of parsleyhalf of a small cucumberhalf of a ripe avocadohalf teaspoon of spirulina powder or if you like a whole teaspoon (mix the spirulina powder with a little water to make thick liquid you'll add it to the juice once its readyand 1 whole brazil nutPack the pears,spinach,parsley and cucumber into a juicer then blend until smooth then peel the avocado and remove the pit its best you use a avocado that is very ripe put it in juicer then blend until smooth,pour into a glass then add the spirulina that you've already mixed to the juice and stiryou can add the chopped brazil nut onto of the juice you've mixed as a garnishand then drink it all up and let your taste buds have a field day in your mouth trust me it's bloody awesome :) I like this product.

I feel SO much better already.The bottle (when opened) does stink, but there's no aftertaste once you take the pills.Update: Just about a week into taking these vitamins, I'm having a mild headache every single day which is abnormal.I did some research and it looks like too much Niacin or Vitamin B can be the culprit which these certainly have lots of.I'm very sensitive to sweeteners and dyes in food.Look for a natural vitamin source with no additives if you have a sensitive system or just want what's best for your body.

This lip balm gives you lips a nice cherry tint that looks natural, and adds color to your complexion.But I want something for smearing a little beyond the lip-line, in the lip creases.What I really want is Neutragena's CoQ-10 lip conditioner with a hint of color.That is not what I'm looking for here.Creamy lip therapy with a hint of color.The Nivea lip care was so well priced considering the size of the tube (MUCH bigger than your typical chapstick tube) that I had to give it a try.The color is very sheer, so light that unless you have pale/light lips you probably won't be able to see any color unless you apply a LOT of this product.I love the feel of this lip balm, but the red color does transfer to the lips.

I personally blend this in in a bullet type personal blender with Almond milk, a small amount of Ensure protein powder (for flavor), a small banana and a scoop of Miralax fiber powder.Make the container the exact size to hold the amount of powder being sold and save some plastic.I will probably purchase this powder again but I really hope they take my suggestions about cutting down the container size and the scoop handle.It's sweet, I'll give it that, but sweet green, like eating sugar on grass.Having said all that, nutritionally, I guess it's pretty good, but I couldn't get past the taste.

It took several tries before I found a stevia that I could stand--some of them taste like nutrasweet to me--in other words, blech.Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition.This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried.It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor.Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking.

I bought these hoping they would help me go into labor earlier.Due to the baby's size my doctor stripped my membranes thinking it would help me go into labor but one week later I was still pregnant and still at a 3.Also, in these two weeks of taking this supplement, one of my hip joints was so excruciatingly painful that I thought I would never be able to walk!After not taking for just one day my hip is already better.I initially decided to give EPO a try because I have PMDD (basically physical pain from ovulation until a few days after period ends) & had read all the glowing reviews of it helping so many with pms.I love Now supplements, but this one is not for this body.I am going to try it again, but only take one a day because they are 500 mg per gel cap.

Winter does not have much daylight where I live and I know I can't get enough sun to make sufficient vitamin D in the winter.I was told they almost unanimousely agreed on the Thorne brand because it is the "purest" Vitamin D3 they found.Thorne is always associated with high quality products and supplements.My Vitamin D levels were pathetically low to which my Natural-path doctor prescribed Thorne D-5000 for me and my wife.I like these because they are easy to swallow and a high quality vitamin D.The price is reasonable and they ship quickly with Prime.Amazon is equal to Costco and less crowded!
