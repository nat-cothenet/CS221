      "[u'I Bought this for 2 reasons.', u'One as a response to my car battery acting weird and another to keep an eye on my boat batteries.', u'It is very accurate, no problems at all.', u'I recently purchased a Schumacher underhood 1.5 amp Trickle Charger, this is a great product to work with a unit like that.', u'You can monitor the charging status of the battery as well as the alternator charging the system with the engine running.', u'I verified the accuracy with both my fluke and extech meters.', u'As winter approaches in Illinois it is important to insure my vehicles are at peak performance all winter.', u'I have one vehicle that sits outside in the cold with an elect.', u'battery blanket, block heater, trickle charger and now I can insure all systems are \"go\" with this product plugged in.', u'I am confident I will be able to easily start my truck no matter what winter throws at me.This seems well built and I was so impressed initially that I picked up two more as x-mas gifts.', u'It came quickly, as most amazon prime orders do, and it worked right away and is accurate enough for my purposes, which is getting a more precise reading on the state of the house batteries in my RV.', u'It give me more info than the RV monitoring panel does, which simply tells me if the batteries are in a good, fair or poor state of charge.', u'I have not used it to check the vehicle battery yet, but I suspect it will work.', u'4 stars is, to me, a product that works as advertised and expected.', u'If the monitor spoke to me in a sexy female  voice I might have given it 5 stars.', u'This is a great product.', u'My use for it is in my travel trailer (TT) which I have a solar charging system in.', u'Rather than buy an expensive battery monitor, I just use this unit to get an idea of the state of the system.', u'I can tell by the voltage the approximate state of my batteries and in the daylight I can tell if the solar is in bulk, absorption, or float.', u'And it is backlit all the time so I can see it in the dark, too.', u\"Whenever a car cannot be started, it's always either 1) the battery is low, 2) battery is bad, or 3) alternator is bad.\", u'Tough to always bring the car in and pay one hour labor for test.', u'Even if some places offer free battery test, it\\'s still a hassle with multiple cars that have lots of electronics in it.This tool is great to check for battery charge level (voltage level), so it\\'s possible to preempt some \"can\\'t start the car\" problems.', u'It can check if alternator is bad (not charging) while car is being driven.', u\"I've also got couple of jump-starters with gel packs with DC sockets, and couple of spare batteries.\", u'This is great to go around to check all batteries, used or not, to be always full.', u'(I attach a DC socket to battery terminal adapter to test spare car batteries) This little monitor works great in my travel trailer.', u'I have a 12v receptacle where the TV would normally go.', u'I bought this to monitor my battery level and I hooked up some harbor freight solar panels so I wanted to see how they would work.', u'This monitor lets me see the current battery level and when the panels are hooked up it shows the charge rate.Cheap and easy, got to love it.', u'Needed something to plug into my 25&#34; camping travel trailer to monitor my 2, 6-volt (connected in series to make one large long lasting 12v battery) batteries ....', u'This thing worked PERFECT!', u'When you turn anything on it register the drop in voltage and just seems to show the correct battery level perfectly at all times.', u'It drops down to yellow when you kick on the heater and what not but that just means it is showing you where the levels are at with that kind of load.', u'Makes monitoring my batteries Simple As Can Be!', u'Basically, this is a voltmeter, similar to a hand-held VOM, and designed to read static voltage and the voltage being pushed to the battery from the alternator as the engine revs ... automobile or motorcycle (having a 12v socket).', u'The cigarette lighter convenience is what attracted me ...', u\"I don't have to juggle a meter and wires with my head under the hood or standing alongside the bike trying to rev it and hold wires and meter, etc.\", u'Tested it already and it seems dead-on with readings at or just a tad under what the hand-held shows.', u\"It's coming on to winter and it's nice, when checking fluids and tire pressure, to do periodic checks on the charging system so you don't get that gut-dropping &#34;click-click-click&#34; when you turn the key in some dark, empty parking lot somewhere you don't want to be!\", u'Works as advertised.', u'I use it in a class C  RV to keep track of charge in the coach batteries.', u'This is an excellent cigarette lighter battery meter, works perfectly.', u'Helped me diagnose a bad alternator in my Escalade and I got the dealer to see it when I brought it in and they just replaced it with no questions asked, that was a $500 alternator.And to the other reviewer who said its not as accurate as a Fluke meter, nonsense.', u'I have a Fluke meter and put it side by side and it was accurate to the Fluke meter to 0.01 volts.', u'If anything this Equus can refresh alot faster then my Fluke can.', u\"At a glance lets you see the state of your battery even from a distance where you can't read it.\", u\"The LED's are handy in addition to the actual voltage readout.\", u'The voltage is accurate.', u\"I use two of them routinely and they're very handy.\", u'I did buy a second one after I found the first one very good.', u'Bought 2 of them from Amazon, came quickly and you can leave them plugged in continuously to monitor your battery and charging system.', u'It is smart to give warning lights as it can differentia between battery and alternator voltage.', u'The picture on Amazon site is not correct.', u'This battery monitor shows the voltage value with .01 precision (or two digits after decimal point).', u'That is far more then enought to tell the battery status.', u'I put it in the car, it automatically switches between \"battery status monitoring\" and \"charging status monitoring\".', u'When the engine is stopped, it is in \"battery status monitoring mode\", when engine is running, it will be in \"charging status monitoring\" mode.', u\"Amazon's price is even bettern then Walmart.\", u'Definitely a great value buy.', u'Will recommend this item to my friends.--- Update ---Amazon has updated the new photo for the product.', u'The picture is correct now.', u'I have an older battery and would recommend this to any one with frequent battery troubles.', u'My battery was dying sporadically for months before I got this, and I knew just how long i could drive before the engine would die thanks to this.', u'Only complaint is it gets in the way when I shift, but otherwise its perfect.', u'Now we  do not have to move it  from car to car.', u'These units work well and are accurate.', u'Recommend one for all your vehicles.', u'I have one of these that I use in one of my older cars.', u'Works great.', u'I had gotten it at Wal-Mart.', u'Fast forward, I wanted to get another, so I went to Wal-Mart to try to pick one up.', u'They didnt have it, just a store brand unit.', u'Wow, what a piece of junk.', u'LCD was poor, would flicker because the refresh rate was not right, had one less decimal place to look at, etc.', u'It was a complete disappointment, considering that at Wal-Mart prices, it was $1.50 higher than the Equus here at Amazon.', u'I returned it and was super-glad that I could find this one here on Amazon.', u'I have it in service and it is absolutely great.', u'It works well, works correctly and is accurate.', u'It has two units past the decimal place, not just one (the picture shows 12.6 as the reading but it would actually give you 12.63, as an example).This is the unit to get, you cannot go wrong.', u'My only desire for improvement would be if the color of the LCD could be varied from just green to maybe red as well.', u'Fits well in my my cars 12 adapter.', u'Display section swivels 180 degrees for convenient viewing.Large easy to read numbers and backlit LCD display.3 LED Warning lights have 2 modes:one mode for battery (motor off) andone mode for alternator (motoring running).', u\"Very useful since you don't need to know the actual voltages for a healthy battery or charging system.ACCURATE.\", u'I checked the voltage reading with a professional calibrated voltmeter and it was within 0.01 volts.', u'(Surprised me it was that accurate)Note: the LCD backlight and 1 led is always on and are bright.', u'This may distracting to some people driving at night.Very happy with this unit.', u'I would buy it again and recommend it to a friend.', u'bought this for my PUP just to keep eye on battery.', u'we dry camp mostly and this item fits the bill.', u'small and easy to use.', u\"UPDATE AS OF 8/26/2013 AT THE BOTTOM:I haven't had this long enough to gauge durability, but will make sure to come back in time, and update this review with reliablity.\", u'The review can loose stars in the future if I have issues, but it works fine for me at this time.I use this exclusively for indicating the state of charge on my sealed lead acid battery in my Little Guy, Silver Shadow camping trailer while it is disconnected from the tow vehicle.I have no need for the feature that tells you if an alternature is charging properly in a car.Although it has 3 LED lights indicating the state of charge for those that aren\\'t familiar with voltage levels versus charge on a lead acid battery, I plan on just using the digital readout to tell the level of charge on my battery after a night of running the \"Fantastic fan\"Just FYI, when I first plugged the unit in the volage read 12.44 and both the green and yellow LEDs were lit.Voltage levels versus state of charge are as follows, but I think this info is also on the package.', u\"I have this device stored in the trailer at the storage area, so I can't remember.12.7=100%12.5=90%12.42=80%12.32=70%12.20=60%12.06=50%11.9=40%11.75=30%11.58=20%11.31=10%As I said, I think that info might be on the package, but I didn't have that handy, so I got that data from battery university.FYI, never run your gelled cell below 20 percent, and not below 50% would be preferable.I'll update if I have any issues.\", u\"Right now it is stored in a hot trailer, so that should give it a good heat test, and I would think bouncing around in the trailer while it is being towed should tell us how durable it is.I'll come back and update this review after some camping trips.Update:  I have had the device for over month now, with it baking in the hot trailer when it isn't in use, and it bouncing around inside the trailer when it is towed, and I can say so far, it works as advertised.\", u'I am satisfied with this purchase so far.Mark Works great for our RV.', u'We always plug this in when we are &#34;off grid&#34; to make sure we have not killed our batteries.', u'Very close to the same readings I get with my multimeter.', u\"If you don't have an accurate &#34;battery&#34; gauge, you'll find this works fine and let's you know exactly what's going on with your charging system.\", u'I use this to monitor battery health in the Jeep (winching, using my on-board air compressor for long periods of time, etc.).', u\"It kind of fluctuates a bit too much for me, but I suppose it's good for what it is though -- if I saw it drop drastically, at least I'd know something's up.\", u'A threshold alarm would be very useful.', u\"Shows battery status with car key on but car not running, and shows alternator status once car is started.Seems quite accurate compared to the readings I get from a quality multimeter.Very simple to use and not too bulky.I'd recommend it.\", u'Light-weight, easy-to-read meter with adjustable head.', u'You can leave it in the electrical socket for constant monitoring or keep it in the tool box or glove compartment for occasional check ups.', u'Highly recommended The information and the price are both right.', u'I use this to check the charging systems on my old cars.', u'Especially those where I no longer trust the gauges.', u'If you have a vehicle - like I do - that turns off the cigarette lighter circuit when you remove the key, then this meter is limited in its usefulness.', u\"Sure you can see what's cooking just by inserting the meter and turning on the ignition (without starting the car).\", u\"But, suppose you want to continuously monitor the battery while it's being trickle charged over a few days and you have removed the keys.\", u\"Can't do.\", u'Still, the unit is well-made, accurate (I checked it against a high quality VOM) and easy to read.', u\"I purchased this neat voltage meter (that's really what it is) a couple of years ago to keep track of the RV's battery voltage.\", u'I checked it against a $300+ Fluke multi-meter I use at work.', u'They were within 1/10th of a volt of each other.', u'10 stars for accuracy.', u'I tapped into a 12 VDC circuit and  installed a 12 volt outlet in my Cougar Travel Trailer so that I could monitor the voltage at all times.', u'This meter has been plugged in there for two years now and is working flawlessly.', u\"Highly recommend this unit if you want to keep track of the battery voltage and the voltage the RV's power converter is putting out.Update 9/6/2013:  Three years now in almost constant use.\", u'Working just fine.', u'Very useful and precise.', u'Even my mechanic asked me to order one for him.', u'Beats opening the hood or even worse on my car, the battery is in the trunk under the floor.', u'A pain to access if you have the optional rubber mat to protect the trunk floor.', u'I use this to monitor my RV battery.', u'Even though I have a solar system charge controller which displays voltage too, I use this sometimes to double check before I plug additional items in one of several 12 volt sockets I had installed.', u\"I like it so much for its simplicity, that I'm buying a 2nd one for my truck.\", u\"This gadget is so simple to use and so accurate, that if you're on the fence about buying this, just do it.\", u'More than worth the price!', u'Gives me a peace of mind at a glance.', u'Many monitors only read to the tenth of a volt, but you really need to read hundreths of a volt (along with approx.', u'battery temperature) to get a good idea of remaining battery capacity.', u'This one has that, and I checked the accuracy against my Fluke digital voltmeter, and it was only 0.02 volts off - good enough.Some other battery voltage monitors have separate plug and monitor panel with a few feet of wire between, but we find it most convenient to have it all in one and tilt the panel for best view.', u\"We pull it out slightly, but leave it in the receptacle, when not reading it so it shuts off - just in case it has a significant power drain itself (someday I'll measure the current drain and see if it can be left plugged in all the time).\", u\"I am very happy with this product.I have multiple electrical issues and my vehicle only has an idiot light that shuts off.This in turn gives a false report and left me stranded as my batteries ran dead.I can now tell that the system is not charging the way it should.I can see if I run the lights and both heater fans it goes to a negative charge.For now if I just run 1 switch I'm OK.I would recommend this to family and friends.\", u'Great to keep track of your battery in a can-am 800 This is an awesome tool, helped figure out if my alternator was going out.', u'Really cheap and good.', u'Almost, pulled my alternator out, but this machine helped to nail down the issue.', u'I got this for my car just to check the battery voltage - auto geek:)  Seems to be doing the job just fine.', u'Nice LCD display, accurate enough for my needs.', u'For the price, it was an easy purchase.', u'We have 12V accessory sockets in our RV and with this monitor we can quickly and accurately check our battery level.', u\"This is a useful device to have in your car but you must understand it's limitations.\", u\"In many cars, it will not be as accurate as taking a reading directly off your battery, which you can do with this device, if you buy this inexpensive additional adapter:Roadpro 12V Battery Clip-On and Cigarette Lighter AdapterThe reason for this is that in vehicles where you have to turn on the ignition to ACC in order to power the cigarette lighter port, once you do that, the vehicle's electronics are also powered and will draw power.\", u'So, you will see a lower reading on this device than if you take a reading directly from the battery with the key out of the ignition.', u'In vehicles where the lighter port is always powered, this device can be more accurately used directly plugged in to that port.However, for taking a reading of your charging circuit with the engine running, this can be used in the lighter port in any vehicle.Note that you can do all of this with any household multimeter however the chances of you having that in the vehicle are slim.', u\"Most all multimeters also require a battery in them so even if you store one of those in your vehicle, the chances are high that when you need to use it, the internal battery will be dead.This Equus unit however requires no internal battery (at least I don't think it has one), so you can just throw it in your glovebox indefinitely.Car batteries typically last around 5 years so after about 3.5 years is when you may want to periodically use this device to check the health of your battery.\", u'Basically, anything under 12v after the vehicle has been sitting for at least 4 hours is a sign the battery should likely be replaced.', u'Above 12v and the battery is probably fine as long as the vehicle starts up.When a friend or relative asks me to check their battery, the first question I ask them is \"Does your cigarette lighter port work all the time, or just when you put the key in the ignition and turn on the car?\".', u\"If they say it's always on, I know I can pretty adequately test their battery just through the lighter port.\", u'If however they say it only turns on when they put their car to ACC, I know I will have to have them open their hood so I can read the battery directly with the Equus.The other good thing about this is that you could leave it plugged in all the time for a constant monitoring of your electrical system voltage while driving and parked.For the price, this device is nice to have if you understand how to use it.If you want a more robust battery tester that can not only give you the voltage, but also the CCA rating (cold cranking amps), I recommend this:SOLAR BA7 100-1200 CCA Electronic Battery and System Tester Easy to use and provides valuable information.', u'According to this my charging system is good but my battery is borderline as I suspected.', u'I leave it plugged in my cigarette lighter so I know at a glance how things are working.', u'but amazon made good and immediately sent me a replacement.', u'I have one in each vehicle in order to monitor alternator and battery health.', u'works like a charm.', u'I keep this in the cup holder in my RV to easily check the status of my engine battery, since my RV sits around more than being used.', u\"It's an easy way to check the battery and know when its time to recharge or replace the battery This is a great product!!!!!!!!!!!!!\", u'I have purchased similar items in the past that did not  perform nearly as well and were not as accurate reading and stable!', u'!You just plug it in to any of your vehicles auxilary power outlets and it lets you know the battery condition with the engine off.', u'Start the engine and it  lets you know how you alternator is doing by the charging voltage.', u'It  also has 3 light emitting diodes red, yellow, and green.', u\"Red  (for very low battery or bad battery cell or poor alternator output)  Yellow (for marginal battery charge or low alternator output)and green (for full battery charge and proper alternator output)'It will also give a red if the alternator output voltage is too high or when a battery charger is connected to the battery.\", u'It is much more accurate than your gauge on your car unless you have a digital voltmeter in your instrument panel.', u'I use it on all of my vehicles, especially the ones with idiot lights or connect it with an auxilary socked with  alligator clips to the battery of vehicles with no  charge indicator.', u'It diagnoses problems  relatively quick and  lets you see a problem before you battery goes dead.']\n"

      "[u'This is one of those things you never want to spend money on until you need it.', u\"This won't fix a sidewall tear but it will do just about any puncture.\", u'For a comparison between this kit and the Power Tank kit (which I would recommend over this ARB kit) see the Power Tank KIT-8133 page.This ARB kit is SOLID.', u'Each tool is incredibly high quality, including the valve core tool and the tire gauge.', u'Even the allen wrenches are high quality.', u\"These tools could stand daily abuse in a tire shop, it seems.The only complaint is that the kit is relatively simple and doesn't include many accessories.\", u\"I'm not entirely sure what the black tubes that it comes with are, but they are very cheap looking plastic and don't seem very functional.The only downside (and what looses 1 star) is that the blow molded case is WAY to big.\", u'It is gigantic compared to the tools it contains.', u'This whole kit should be at least 1/3 the size.', u\"The fact that it is this big now means that I can't find any appropriate space/room for it in my Wrangler JK.\", u\"It sticks out like a sore thumb and storage space in a Jeep is at a premium to begin with.If you're the casual 5-10 time/year user or less, then go with the Power Tank kit.\", u'It will suit you much better (it also has more accessories) because it is much smaller and lighter.', u\"If you're a heavy 1/week user, then buy ARB.\", u\"You won't regret either decision, though.\", u\"I won't rehash all the glowing reviews about this sets' superior construction and content.\", u'I will say that both its handles survived multiple whacks with a drive hammer and survived.', u'It is billed as a \"4x4\" repair kit for off road tires, but will also work quite well on passenger car tires.So here\\'s my experience with a few pointers to make things easier.First after you gather all the tools, lube, cement (more on this later), pre-thread the rope plug through the needle, making sure you have 2 even length plug \\'legs\\' bent upwards towards the handle.', u'Locate the puncture, pre-lube the reamer and have at it per the instructions.', u'You really will have to twist and drive the reamer past the tread belts.', u'Although you can repair a tire on the car, you need so much leverage to drive the reamer, (and the plug needle) through the tread and tread belts, it will be difficult.', u'I would estimate 50-75lbs of arm pressure is needed to push through.', u'The tougher the tire (i.e.', u'LT type tires with a lot of tread), the more you will have to push.', u\"Here's tip # 1; take advantage of the removable handle on the reamer (hex key supplied with kit), and attach just the tool shaft to your electric drill--instant ream job!\", u\"Just don't overdo it!Now that you've rounded and trimmed off the puncture all the way through the tread, cord, and belts, use the reamer as a 'plug' to stop any additional air from escaping.\", u\"Things go better with air pressure in the tire since it supports the tread around the 'target area', so don't let the whoosh of escaping air rattle you.Next, remove the reamer.\", u'Air will escape, but if you have about 20-25 PSI of air pressure left in the tire, you will have plenty of time to grab your loaded plug needle and put it in the hole.', u'My first repair was rear tire on a sports car.', u'Very limited working space=very little leverage.', u'I could not drive home the plug.', u'Tip #2.', u'The solution was to coat the plug and needle with rubber cement(purchase separately as it is not supplied)(disclaimer: I think this was mentioned in a previous review-thanks).', u'The cement acted as a lubricant, and while still difficult, I finally was able to drive the plug home.', u'In my case, the kit-supplied lube was ineffective.', u'It probably would have been different if I removed the tire however.Note: This is an \"open eyelet\" kit.', u\"The plug 'needle' has a open slot to facilitate its removal from the tire whilst leaving the plug in place.\", u'DO NOT rotate the needle when driving the plug into the puncture.', u'You risk spreading/breaking the eyelet off the needle shank within the tire, or jamming up the eyelet with the twisted plug.Feel free to drive the plug all the way into the tire until the sliding cone stops your motion.', u'NO fear of going too far.', u'Put pressure on the sliding cone, holding it against the tire, while pulling the needle out.', u'The plug is now perfectly seated in the puncture.', u'Just trim the leftover exposed nub with a blade, leaving about 1/8\" excess above the tread, so it can be further seated by the rolling tire.One final point, you really need to carry, or have access to, an air compressor or air pump to re-inflate your repaired tire.', u\"Otherwise driving on a severely under inflated tire is inviting a blow out.Like everything else, this kit has it's limitations.\", u\"It probably won't work if you have impaled a railroad spike as you cannot 'double up' the plugs.\", u'Also, side wall repair is out-too much flexing.', u'Same with angled punctures.', u'However, when done properly, the self vulcanizing plugs should last the remaining life of the tire.', u'Happy plugging!', u'I tried an alternative but this kit appears well made.', u'I did purchase some liquid rubber and gizzed up the plug a little before I installed it.', u'Has not leaked at all since installation.', u'Not cheap but this is a good kit and I would recommend it!', u'I have a car that used to have run flats and wanted to add a plugging kit to my compressor I keep in the trunk.', u\"I didn't want to rely on a $5 kit if I ever need to use it - which I haven't.\", u'So I purchased this hoping it was well made.', u'It is.', u'The handles are all metal and big enough you can put a reasonable sized hand on them.', u'The cleaner piece is smoother than I expected but maybe that is a good thing.', u'There is a decent little container of lub and a BUNCH of plugs.', u'The case is way more than what I want to carry so I put the two handles, lube, kit of other things (a nice adder, it has parts for the valve stem and other things) and 5 plugs into my air compressor case.', u'My only complaints are that it is a lot more than the cheaper kits and the case could be a lot more compact.', u'I think those things are minor - me being picky.', u'If you want a robust kit, I think this is it.', u'I received this tire repair kit as a gift for my birthday.', u'I do some off roading on occasion with my truck and punctures are unfortunately common.', u'I not only hate the inconvenience of having a flat, but hate worse the charge and wait part of taking it to a service station to get fixed.', u'In the past I have owned other repair kits, but admittedly they have been cheap ones.', u'Too often they have broken on me, gotten twisted, or just were difficult to use.', u'This ARB tire seal set is top quality all the way.', u'It may be more expensive than most, but this is certainly one of those times that you really do get what you pay for.', u'The tools are heavy and very rugged, and the accessories make a joke of what I have in the cheaper set I own.', u'I punctured and old tire I had on a rim in a couple of places and used this set to patch it with excellent results.', u'It was easy, fast, and the tire has been holding air solidly since then.', u'Lets face it, when you have a flat its always a pain in the rump and a total inconvenience.', u'This set can repair a tire in no time and be permanent.', u'The tools are top quality and you can buy replacement seals right here on Amazon.', u\"Absolutely the best, and highly recommended...: ) Haven't had a chance to use these yet but they look very well made, much better than your typical automotive store crap I have purchased those cheap kits for tire repair and they are just to flimsy and wanted something stout enough to last and I found it with this kit.\", u\"Not cheap but very very sturdy and you don't have to worry about bending the tips.\", u'This should last a life time and all you will need to but are replacement plugs.', u'Very pleased with the construction.', u'After getting a big nail in my tire of my truck, I tried using my tire plug kit that I had from our car..... fortunately when the handle broke it did not go through my hand.... so a coworker had a kit similar to this (same kit, but a red case) and for the act of having to plug a tire, it was a pleasure to use.', u'As soon as I got home, I ordered this kit.Since then I have had to use it twice... once on my truck and once as a favor to a neighbor.', u'The handles are great as they are big, beefy, and unlike the other local auto store kits, you will not injure yourself.The only problem that I have had with my truck is the composition of the tires... they are thick.', u'With that, the reamer that is included works well, but what I use instead is a drill with a drillbit to ream out the hold.', u'On a car tire, that is not necessary, but on a truck (I have a Toyota Tundra) it just makes the job easier.Besides that, it is a great kit and I take it everywhere I go.', u'My dad also needed a kit and I sent one to him as a gift--- he has used it twice and he also believes it is one of the best kits he has ever owned.']\n"

      "[u'Lexol leather conditioner did a fine job.', u'I use the leather conditioner on the leather in my almost 4 year old car, as well as an old comfy leather arm chair.', u'I put the product on the leather, wait a few minutes for it to get absorbed a bit, and then use a micro fiber towel to clean off.', u'The Lexol leather conditioner did a fine job in cleaning and softening the leather.The price on the conditioner in the last twelve month ranged from $11.24 to $7.99, so the price as I write this review is very good.', u'Note on price research: I found a very helpful tool that shows me the history of Amazon prices, you can find it by searching from Amazon price history and pick the one with the camel in the name.', u'I find it very helpful.A quick note on the spray vs cream packaging.', u'In the past I have used leather conditioning creams, so I bought the spray to compare how it would work.', u'I have to say that overall I like the conditioning cream better because I have more control over where the product is applied.', u'This especially the case when I work inside of the home on my leather chair.', u'When I get to the edges I have to be careful not to over spray.', u'I have just bought this product after using some of the cheaper ($6) leather conditioners for a while.', u'This one certainly seems to be the best at rejuvenating leather.', u\"You can feel the waxy film on your fingers after applying it, which you don't notice with other conditioners, and shows it has somethign substantial in it.All my vehicles have had leather seats and after a few years they have all had dry, cracked creases.\", u'I have just got a \"new\" used minivan with leather seats and I want to ensure they don\\'t go the same way.', u\"I have to admit I've neglected seats compared with the rest of the vehicle.I used this product on my 1998 pickup's tan-colored front seats which are creased and starting to crack in places.\", u'They were pretty dirty and the only way I found to get the grime out was using a Magic Eraser and leather cleaning solution.', u'This is a pretty harsh technique, but effective, apart from in the deepest creases.', u'It did seem to take the shine off the leather, which was a worry.', u'Using the Lexol conditioner, letting it soak in for 15 mins and then buffing with a microfiber cloth, the sheen is back and the leather feels much more supple.', u'It will never return to its \"new\" state, but it should last a few more years with regular applications (not sure but maybe every 3-4 months?).', u'It takes some effort to get through the stickiness at the first buffing, but the surface quickly eases up and a nice sheen (not a false shine) appears.On my minivan, the leather came up like it was just new.', u'It smells good too!I bought this product at my local Advance Auto (sorry Amazon!)', u'and would certainly suggest you pay the extra $3-4 over the other conditioners as it really seems to be properly designed to replace the oils in the leather, not just put a protectant shine on the surface.', u\"I'm always sceptical about product claims (since they usually exaggerate performance), but this one seems to be the real deal.Try it.UPDATE (Dec 3 2009):The stiff leather has certainly become more supple after applying this product - it works really well!\", u'Auto detail shops use this product that says a lot.', u'Also I used it on my leather couch and it looks like new.', u'I had some very badly dried areas and it took care of them.', u'Make sure you use the cleaner first especially on older items.', u\"On new things it probably isn't necessary but if you have it use it anyway.\", u'Use clean cotton cloths and follow the directions.', u'Its a great leather conditioner, I use it all the time i highly recommend this product.', u'I am pleased with the ongoing results on my leather car seats.', u'Unfortunately i did not use this from amazon, because of the poor packaging, it leaked all over the place.', u'I used this after the Lexol cleaner, and it did a terrific job on our seats.', u'It was easy to apply, and when buffed out, the material looked great.', u'I have been using this product for several years on my leather products and highly recommend it.', u'I have an 2004 Chevy PU with 1/4 million miles and the leather seats are still in great shape, most pickup I see with leather have holes worn through from lack of care.', u'I use it on my cars and leather furniture as well with the Lexol cleaner to preserver the life of the leather.', u'I bought this with the leather cleaner.', u'I found it to be very good, but you have to wait for it to dry, which takes about a day.', u'It does not stay as tacky as the leather honey conditioner which I also have bought.', u'I feel the honey conditioner will be better in the long run, but if the leather is delicate the honey could potentially make it worse because it is very sticky and can wear the material as you rub it in.', u'So in the long run, this is a great option.', u'Decades ago during high school and surfing, custom sandles were the thing.', u'Bought a nice pair and shoe maker recommended Lexol.', u'Fifty years?', u'Ok those sandles are gone but.....Used it ever since on shoes, chairs, jackets, and any other leather.', u'Inherited a two hundred year old leather book.', u'Lexol!', u'Amazing difference.Motorcycle friend had

Dooney is ten years old and looking better than me.Wonder if it works on \"live\" leather?Addendum:For years I did not use cleaner then I tried some and now appreciate it\\'s benefits.', u'My car seats definitely need Lexol Cleaner, orange bottle, first.', u'They are darker from rubbed on grime over months of body pressure.Cleaning brightens colors AND ADDS MOISTURE.', u'By cleaning first you remove old oils mixed with dirt when that is removed the conditioner penetrates deeper and faster.', u'Cleaner does not work like normal soap or deterent it cleans and restores and primes leather for conditioner.', u'Just give it a try.Its a hassle and extra work but the result is obviously better.', u'It might even be possible to use cleaner without conditoner the cleaner moisturizes too but conditioner seams to seal the surface after it dries unlike the cleaner.', u'You will be surprised how much dirt is on the cloth after cleaning.', u'I change cloths positions to use new clean areas as dirt is removed.', u'A little cleaner goes a long ways, Chairs can get quite dirty from body oils I guess.', u'This stuff is a very good conditioner for your boots and other leather products.', u'It was recommended to me by the local shoe repair guy.', u\"I'm very happy with it.\", u'I would definitely buy it again.', u'It does seem to last for a while.', u'Updated January 20, 2013I use this product on my Flexsteel leather couch, a high-quality couch.', u\"It's a super long couch because it is actually two loveseats assembled together.\", u'Each loveseat has an arm, one left and the other right.', u'Putting them together makes it one giant piece.', u\"It's a lot of leather and that's why I bought this large container.I found that I had to buff a LOT more than I expected.\", u'It took days for the conditioner to completely sink in after application, but I applied a heck of a lot thinking I was saving time.', u'You should be aware that buffing will probably be required and it will take some time for the leather to absorb the conditioner.The result is remarkable.', u'The color of the leather seems more vibrant and it has a shine actually.', u'Ultimately, this is protective of the leather and will make it last a lot longer.', u'In the meantime, it makes the leather look richer.One thing you will have a lot of trouble figuring out based on looking at product information for a large piece of leather furniture is what type of product should be used on it.', u\"If you have an expensive piece, most likely there won't be instructions for this.\", u\"That's because the manufacturer doesn't want to take chances by informing you which conditioner you may use.\", u\"The retail representatives that I questioned didn't know anything about treating leather.Lexol works just fine on an expensive leather couch as my experience continues to show.\", u'This large container goes far.', u'I would not waste money on small highly-branded boutique products when in my experience this product has worked perfectly on very good leather.', u\"Friend of mine who works with leather every single day told me a few options of products in order to care my car leather seats, I pic this brand of the options he gave me .. and so far I'm well pleased.\", u'The leather sofa, love seat, chair and ottoman were faded and looking rough.', u'One bottle of Lexol restored them to new condition.', u'I cleaned some worn and stained areas with a good saddle soap with a day to dry.', u'Then in one day I was able to go over the furniture with one coat.', u'Use a dish sponge with the blue scrubber top.', u'Use the sponge part, not the scrubber.', u'The scrubber worked well with saddle soap to clean.Let dry for a day.', u'Repeat.', u'Expect the leather to darken.', u'The white stains are curing salts that have worked their way out of the leather.', u'They melt with the Lexol and return into the leather.The result is a buttery soft leather that looks great.', u'I applied this based on other users responses.', u'It seemed to soften the leather.', u'I will see how it goes with continued usage The Lexol Leather conditioner contains special oils that rejuvenates and

I've only tried Lexol and Blue Magic.\", u'Blue Magic left the leather feeling a bit dry.', u'However this Lexol gives the leather a good slick feel.The instructions state to apply then let sit for 15 minutes or so then \"wiping off excess\" as necessary.', u\"Granted, upon application it feels sticky and a little greasy, and 15 minutes of sitting doesn't resolve this so you can wipe down lightly with a dry cloth if you think it will help.\", u\"However, I found for best results, apply the conditioner then let it sit on the leather for about a day (two if you can help it) and don't wipe down.\", u\"I know this doesn't sound practical for most people but I do think it gives the best results for good feel and well conditioned leather.Use this after cleaning with Lexol leather cleaner

quickly.\", u\"I have no way of knowing if this is the best product on the market, but nonetheless it's pretty darned good!\", u'The leather conditioner is great, but the price is a bit high for the amount in the bottle I think.', u'I bought this conditioner last year for my leather furniture and have been very happy with the results.', u\"It does need to be applied every few months, but I've used it on a variety of leather surfaces (worn leather sofa, dining room chairs with leather padding, office chair) with excellent results.\", u\"As long as you don't apply it too thick, it won't leave an oily residue, and it blends into the leather very nicely.\", u\"I've gone through the original bottle and a refill, and am about to order another refill.For application, the Lexol sponges work great.\", u'They can be rinsed and reused and last a long time.', u'I read with interest many of the other reviews.', u'It seems everyone but myself has heard of this brand.', u'I have been using car leather conditioner bought at the parts store on my truck seats, a couch, and two recliners.The car conditioner worked ok but was expensive and harder to apply.This just floats on with a small cloth.........I put in on rather heavy since my leather had not been treated for over 6 months.The difference was amazing.', u\"My leather returned to it's new look and after a week I see no evidence of the smooth leather glow going away.\", u\"Well...typical of buying things on the internet, it wasn't as large as it looks, but it's still larger than what I've bought in the past for less money...so....I'm not griping.\", u'I have a great friend in the uphostery business and he swears by it, so I use it.', u'After being in the auto detailing business for awhile and trying a lot of different leather conditioners I can say that this is the best conditioner that I have used.', u'Really softens the leather and gets the leather back to a natural \"off of the factory\" look.', u'I use Lexol leather conditioner on the leather seats in the car and leather furniture.', u'Makes the leather very soft and pliable.', u'I have used this stuff ever since it came out.', u\"It's not messy

underside of the seat.', u'Once I figured out how to unhook that, I was able to access the flaps of the seat covers, and finish installation.I got two slightly different \"versions\" of the Braxton seat covers.', u'My grey set is, according to the date on the box, a few years older than the tan set.', u'The flap on the older seat covers is a simple flap with two holes in it.', u'The tan set I have has flaps with four holes in them, and the end of the flaps also have a spongy, cylindrical insert in them.', u'This insert is presumably intended to help keep the seat cover in place.', u'The additional holes must be to accommodate different seat designs.', u'I found both changes (the extra holes and the spongy insert) completely needless, but maybe on some vehicles they would be

      "[u'Overall, this is a very good wheel brush.', u'The bristles are long and soft, so no worries about scratching or overly harsh treatment of the wheels it cleans.The brush area is very large, so those who have wheels or rims with intricate openings may need an additional cleaning aid.', u'My wheels are like this, and so I go behind this brush with a washcloth for the deep detailed parts of the wheel.I also wish the handle of this brush was slightly longer; another 4 to 8 inches would provide better leverage.', u\"What's not to like about a wheel brush?\", u':)  This brush actually does beat other brushes out there.', u'The bristles are just right for my chrome/clad rims.', u'I have noticed any scratching at all and have been using for a year.', u'Water and soap only.', u\"I bought the Mother's Wheel Brush to help keep the spoke wheels on my Harley clean.\", u'They look great, but are a pain to keep clean.', u'This brush helps clean them in one swipe.', u'The softness of the brush keeps from putting any marks on your wheels or tires.', u'Medium bristled brush is just right for my truck wheels, to get into the tight spots.', u'Soft enough not to scratch the finish.', u'The bristles are much softer than I thought.', u'I use this for washing my convertible top.', u\"If you're looking for a brush to really scrub something, you might want to find a brush with stiffer bristles.\", u'I already had a wheel brush however it was beginning to reach its useful life so I looked around and found what I think is one if not the best wheel brush on the market.', u'This one is 10 times better than the one I am tossing.', u'I especially like the handle as the soapy water tended to make the all plastic handle on the  other brush slip in my hands.', u'This is a very good product that should last for years.', u'Does a good job on your \"tires\".', u\"Has a threaded hole for an extension stick so you don't need to reach down as far.You should use a microfiber towel and detail spray on your wheels.\", u'Treat the \"painted\" finish on your wheels just like you do your cars body.', u'They have a clear coat and finish just like your cars body.', u\"I'm pretty happy with this brush as it can get in to a lot of nooks and crannies of the wheels.\", u\"The bristles are soft, so I feel confident that it isn't damaging my painted wheels while cleaning them.\", u'My only suggestion which prompts me to give it four stars instead of 5, is a change to the design.', u'While trying to get in to all of those nooks and crannies, it would be helpful to have the bristles going in multiple directions, not just straight out the brush facing one way.', u'The edges of the flat part where the bristles come out, came in to contact with my wheels over and over.', u\"If there were bristles coming out of the top, I wouldn't be banging that rubbery part on my wheels but instead cleaning the wheels that much faster.\", u'Just my opinion Another quality product from Mothers.', u\"I am not sure that you necessary need a brush dedicated to wheels, but considering how dirty they get, it's probably a good idea.\", u\"Well, it's a brush but I've never bought them before but it worked amazing and wasn't too rough but perfect to scrub :D This works awesome for cleaning wheels and rims!\", u'The brush is very soft so it wont scratch the rims and it gets into a lot of the nooks in crannies!', u'I really like this wheel brush and would highly recommend it!', u'Works well at getting between wheel spokes.', u'The handle is a little short, but fits comfortably.', u'Overall, a good purchase for cleaning\\\\detailing your ride.', u'Ordered this brush as a replacement - misplaced my old one.', u\"Mother's makes quality products.\", u'Amazon makes my shopping so easy - competitive prices, fast delivery...no surprises!', u'Alround great brush.', u'Good for all parts of the car that can be hard to clean with a sponge/mitt.', u'Especially good on grill and wheels.', u'I really like this brush to clean the rims of my car.', u'Made from good quality materials.', u\"The bristles are soft yet sturdy, so they won't damage your wheels, but get most of the grime off.Another quality item from Mothers.\", u\"One of the best wheel brushes I've ever owned.\", u'In fact, the best.', u\"In fact, the only wheel brush I've ever owned.\", u'This mothers wheel brush gets right into the cracks to clean my chrome wheels very well without me worrying about scratches.', u\"I got this to clean off the brake dust and general grime from driving around NJ roads.I use it with Meguiar Car Wash and find it works extremely well with a little effort.The brush base has a rubber bumper, so you can get in between the sections of the hub cap and not have to worry about scratching or scuffing anything -- I use it on a 2009 Honda Fit Sport (tiny wheels) and a 2011 Subaru Outback and it does both really well with a little angling to get into the tight spots.The bristles are quite soft -- and initially I was worried they wouldn't do the job -- but they actually work well and get the hub caps and wheels clean.Combined with a spray off with the power washer - makes the job alot easier -- WELL WORTH THE MONEY!\", u\"No wonder this is the best wheel brush I have ever used so far, you know how complicated it is to brush the expedition's wheels, as they have too many openings and decoration.\", u'This girl does the job perfectly.', u'I would recommend it to anyone Great price for the product only bad thing is it might be too big for smaller rims, I have 5 spoke 17 inch rims so its fine but I could see how that could be a problem on other wheels to get way in the back.', u\"I don't use this on my rims, a old terry cloth and some wheel cleaner is much better for that.\", u'This is however a very good wheel well brush.', u'It would better if the handle was longer.', u'gently cleans without scratching your wheel.', u'make sure to wash the bristles after each wash so the residue is removed.', u'The handle is a prefect length and the brush has a nice head to it.', u'I wish the bristles were a little bit more firm but it gets the job done with proper cleaners.', u'The short handle makes this easy to control and the soft bristles are made for finishing not scrubbing.', u'Depending on the job a slightly stiffer brush should be a starter and this used for final cleaning of wheels that can stand the abrasion.', u'I have been using this brush to clean the wheels on my 2011 Subaru for a year now and it is holding up well.The lengthy soft bristles do a great job of getting in and around all the nooks and crannies of my aluminum wheels so they look good and I never have to worry about scratches.', u\"The bristles have remained in the same condition since it was new.This brush may be too soft if you're using it to clean really nasty dirty wheels but for the average wash job it gets it done!\", u\"it works well.but it doesn't clean tighter areas because its a little too wide.but it is still very convenient.\", u'This brush is great.', u'It is the perfect size, not too big and not too small.', u'The bristles are stiff but not stiff enough that you have to worry about damaging anything with it.', u\"The item is really well made and you can't tell if it's chinese or not by the plastic quality or weight.The black part is really rubberized and there's the gap for the thumb, what helps a lot.The brushed do tend to fade just a little bit and one or another part might fall aside.\", u'For the places it can reach the dirty stays on it, away from the wheel.', u\"One can notice there is a rubber surrounding the brush that prevents it from hurting the wheel, it's perfect.For big sized wheel, GO FOR IT!\", u'I use this on my 1997 Grand Cherokee, my 2010 Grand Cherokee and my dads Camaro with chrome rims.', u'Extremely durable and works great.', u'I have used it on both chrome and aluminum wheels and have not had a single problem with scratches.', u'This really is the best brush I have ever owned and gets into all the rim crevasses easily without my hands getting cut.', u'The handle is very comfortable and has great grip.', u\"I suggest you pick this upPROS:Works GreatExtremely DurableComfortable HandleCONS:None that I have found I'll be honest, I'm not even sure exactly what part of the wheel this brush is supposed to clean.\", u'But I needed a brush to clean the rims of my car (which were pretty dirty) and this generally did the trick.', u'First off, I did not use a high pressure water hose, just a normal one, this brush, and a bucket with car soap.', u'And by and large it helped get most of the grime gently off my rims.', u\"The bristles are definitely soft, which is good because it won't scratch your rims.\", u'At the same time though, because the bristles were soft, it was unable to get out some of the heavy dirt that was caked in.', u'Also, this brush has a relatively wide area so I could clean the outer surface of my tire and rim quickly.', u'However, because it was big, it was difficult getting access to the nooks and crannies of my rims.', u\"For that, I recommend getting a Mother's Detail Brush which is more narrow (think of it as dental floss vs. toothbrush)Mothers Detail Brush Set - 2 Pack.\", u'The brush itself is quite durable and ergonomic, and not too heavy.', u'One other issue I had is that once I cleaned my wheels once, a lot of dirt got into the bristles and i was unable to wash that color out.', u\"Though I don't think it tracks dirt once I washed it out.\", u'My old brush was getting worn out and losing bristles so it was time to replace.', u'This new brush does a good job of cleaning my wheels.', u'I am pleased with my purchase.', u'This wheel brush is great for cleaning wheels.', u'Go figure!', u'But seriously...', u'I was previously using a sponge and this is worlds better.', u'perfect for your rims doesnt scratch or mar paint or chrome and it gets all that nasty brake dust off with ease this brush is the perfect size and has just the right amount of rigitity and softness to clean the many curves and hollows in my wheels.', u'I bought this specifically to clean tires and wheels and it does a great job!', u'Whether using wheel cleaner or soap, this scrubs off the grime on my tires and wheels.', u'I like this one slightly better than its long-handled cousin.', u'A nice balance between soft bristles with enough strength to clean the wheels.', u'The bristles are flexible enough to get into the deep crevices around the wheel lugs.', u'The bristles also seem durable.', u'After brush cleaning my wheels, the wheel brush bristles have maintained their shape.', u\"They aren't squashed, bent, twisted, etc.\", u'This large sized brush is great for cleaning the wheel face and other easily accessible areas.', u'If you have wheels with a lot of spokes, you may need a second, smaller brush to get in-between the narrow openings.', u\"i purchased this brush because i bought new rims and tires for my truck, and didn't want to take a chance on scratching them up.\", u\"I use this with the Mother's Wheel cleaner and all I can say is WOW!A must have for cleaning your whip's feet!\", u'Nice long bristles that are just stiff enough to get deep in the crevices of my difficult wheels.', u\"I also appreciate the rubber bumper around its perimeter so that I'm not scuffing my wheels' paint, because that's really easy to do.\", u'Loved this brush so much that I bought it again when the first one wore out.I use this mainly for cleaning the wheels on our vehicles.', u'The brush is soft enough to get into all areas that I need it to go.', u'good quality I bought this brush because I had been using a long handled version of it at the local car wash thought I might get my own one for use at home works really well and gets in the slots of my wheels easy that might not be so for other cars but a nice soft and large head makes it handy also the brush works well in really hot water as well a bonus as some brushes get weird in hot water Makes cleaning even the most detailed rims with ease without scratching the surface.', u'Mothers Wheel Brush is ergonomic, has long bristles for getting into deep spaces of wheel and works well in combination with Mothers Contoured Tire Brush and Carrand 93017 Grip Tech  Sheepskin Wheel Cleaners for serious cleaning.', u\"It's a good wheel brush with a good rubber grip and rubber around the head to prevent scratching your wheels.\", u\"You can work the bristles into the lug nut holes decently because they're long enough, but if your wheels are really dirty don't expect miracles.\", u'Only four stars because you will get splattered with whatever tire/wheel cleaner you use if you are not careful because the bristles are kinda long.', u'Overall all, a good brush to have to keep your wheels clean.', u'Anyone who takes pride in keeping their car clean should have this for the wheels and the long handle version for the wheel wells.', u'The bristles are nice and long (and soft) to get into my WS6 Snowflakes on my 1980 Trans Am.', u'Keeps the wheels nice and clean, and also is gentle on the paint in the spokes of my snowflakes.', u\"I've had the long handled Mother's Wheel Brush for some time now and decided to try the short handled one.\", u'You are able to better control the short handled brush and apply more pressure when needed.', u'I like them both and think they are great wheel brushes.', u'Bought this along with two detail brushes.', u'This one handles the brake dust that can be easily removed.', u'the detail brushes are better for the more difficult to reach spots.', u'I used this brush to clean my engine bay.', u'It works great.', u'I also used this to clean my wheels.', u'It worked great there too.', u'I purchased this brush, and another cheaper one at the local auto parts store.', u\"This Mother's brush by far is better than the others I've tried.\", u\"The difference in the Mother's brush is it is super soft, and soaks up and holds soap like a sponge; the cheaper brushes do not hold soap as well.\", u'My only complaint is the size, but depending on your application, it could be perfect.', u\"I obviously wouldn't deduct  stars based on size since I knew the size before purchasing.\", u'A must have for cleaning alloy wheels with spokes where fingers are difficult to use because of narrow gaps.', u'The rubber edges prevent scratches.', u'Recommend that you clean it right after use with mild detergent cleaner to prevent the bristles caking up with the muck coming off the wheels Very, very nice product!', u'I bought one for cleaning my wheels, found it sooo nice, I had to pick one up for the father-in-law.', u'The brush has a nice rubber bumper that surrounds the edge (note the black around the red), so its easy on the wheels but tough on brake dust!I have used Mothers products for years and will continue doing so.', u\"I bought this for the wheels on my wife's car but soon discovered that it works well to clean just about anything a rag had trouble reaching, like the grill, the emblems, etc.\", u'I can even do a pretty good job around the lug nuts.', u'There are cheaper versions out there, but I like everything about this one so I recommend it.', u'Good construction for the prices and gets the job done.', u'Comfortable handle and stiff-enough bristles.', u'Not really sure what else you were looking for in a wheel brush.', u'top quality, i used for everything, not only wheels lol, very good product, i would recommend for anybody.', u'WHEEL brush way to go All I can truly say is that this is a great product.', u'I like the fact that it is sturdy and well built for long term usage.', u\"I will buy more Mother's products in the future.\", u'I use this brush with a wheel cleaner to keep my chrome wheels shiny.', u'It is good for broad areas and the bristles are strong.', u'The brush rinses clean with a strong spray of water.', u'To clean the lug nuts, you should also purchase smaller brushes.', u'This is described as a wheel brush, but i use it all over my car.', u'It does a really good job of getting the soap spread and remove the dirt.', u'A must for any person who takes care of their car regularly.', u'I bought this brush in conduction with the brake dust brush to make it easier to clean my wheels.', u'I usually have to use the rag and several fingers to get all the cracks and crevices in the wheel.', u'Between the two brushes, I can get everything very easily.The handle is easy to hold and the brush is  a good size.', u'This was great for the flat, surface features of the wheel and the tire itself.', u'The brake dust brush handled the crevices very well.', u'Glad to add this brush to my car wash arsenal.', u'feels a bit cheap, but it works.', u\"don't know how long it'd last but it seems to do it's job for now This brush is fantastic.\", u\"It's not really stiff, so you don't have to worry about scratching your rims.\", u\"Yet, it's durable enough to get a lot of the dirt/grime.\", u'Works as described.', u'Great addition to any car wash set.',

which shipping is free and quick.', u\"I save mostly on sales tax and it's nice to have something come right up to your door, and not have to wait in line at the local Whale-Mart.\", u\"This is the best stabilizer I've ever used.\", u'Absolutely awesome!', u'I use it in all of my power equipment.', u'Lawnmower, chainsaw, power washer, boat, etc.', u'Great product for those with gas powered marine applications like outboard motors and the like.', u'Good year round or for off season storage.', u\"Use this with every tankful on my mower and other small machinery that sits around between uses, and haven't had any ethanol related problems (gumming up.)\", u\"Excellent for winter storage to if you don't want the hassle of draining the carbs, gas tanks whatever.\", u'I use this in my mower for winter, and it seems to do a very good job.', u\"The mower always starts on the first pull in the spring, which didn't used to happen before I started using STA-BIL.\", u\"It's hard to find gasoline that hasn't been contaminated by ethanol, so this product becomes necessary to minimize the damage that can be caused, including rusty gas tanks, corroded carburetor/fuel injectors, and premature fuel pump failure.We put a heavy dose of marine-grade Sta-Bill in our trailer boat's on-board gas tank for storage over the winter.We also use a substantial amount in two vintage automobiles that sit for months at a time.For best protection, add this to the gas tank, make sure it's sloshed around by driving the car or towing the boat around, and operate the engine long enough for the substance to have circulated all the way through the gasoline lines and fuel system.\", u'The EPA is full of gas with their mandate of having ethanol in gas.', u'It contains less energy, costs more, and gunks up carburetors on small engines unless you buy an additive such as this one.', u'Almost a decade ago, we belonged to a classic car club.', u'In 2005, when the wonderfully intelligent folks in Washington DC decided to require that gasoline must be cut with ethanol, classic cars starting breaking down like crazy.', u'About the same time I began to notice a loss of power and rough idling in my 2005 Mustang GT.', u'Strange coincidence?', u'Nope...Our mechanics found no problems... they basically told us that Ethanol sucks.', u'To be more exact, Ethanol sucks energy out of your car by generating lots of water vapor that condenses and turns into water inside your engine as the engine cools down.', u'This then leads to all sorts of bad things happening inside your engine including rough idle, corrosion, reduced power and a failure to easily start.Ethanol is really just a form of alcohol produced from distilling plant matter, and that alcohol picked up other decades-old particulates in the gas tanks and fuel lines of the classic cars... moving all that old junk to fuel filters and engines, causing them to clog and seize.', u'Alcohol also breaks down plastics and many rubbers, including those used in gas and oil lines & hoses of most lawn equipment and many older vehicles.', u\"What a mess.Across the board, our club's mechanics recommended a two pronged attack on Ethanol's detrimental effects: (a) regular use of STA-BIL to remove moisture from the tank & line while stabilizing the Ethanol in the tank to minimize further moisture production; and (b) periodic application of a fuel system cleaner like SeaFoam or BG44K (our choice, which I have used every three or four months since).Our mechanic recommended using the marine version of STA-BIL in our cars, saying that it just seems to work that much better than the regular stuff (but you do pay a bit more for it).\", u'Sometimes the marine version is tough to find around here so we use the regular STA-Bil too.', u'Since we have been using STA-BIL to remove moisture and BG44K to clean the system and enhance performance, both my Mustang and our 1930 Ford Model A seem to have run much smoother.Thankfully, the EPA has now recognized that data actually shows ethanol is not as environmentally friendly as ethanol advocates claimed it would be (surprise, surprise... look who made money on that scheme) and the EPA has cut back Ethanol requirements starting 2014.', u'Even if the EPA gets rid of the Ethanol requirement, STA-BIL and BG44K have proven their worth to us and we will continue using them from now on.If you have something similar going on and you know it is not a mechanical issue, give this stuff a try.', u'Totally recommended based on our experiences in the cars we have owned.Go for it.', u'While designed for marine applications where the fuel sits for extended periods, I use it to protect my 4KW RV generator when in storage.', u'I used this stuff on a boat I put aside for 2+ yrs and the fuel is still burning as if new.', u'I HATED to leave the fuel in the tank that long but it could not be helped and the Stabil did its stuff.', u'I would add it to any combustion engine not run regularly and even those that are with carbs especially.', u'Try not to use ethanol laced fuel in low use applications and always splash this stuff in your tank.', u'Your life will improve and others will admire you.', u'This is basically the same as regular sta-bil but with twice the potency...definitely a better buy than the red stuff.', u'I use it every time I fill up the gas can for my lawn products.', u'I never have a problem starting up after storage when using the product.', u'Keeps the ethanol at bay and engines cleaner.']\n"

comes alive, like smiling at you.I finished restoring a 35 yrs old BMW classic and this is the last stage.One has to be careful since other drivers keep looking at your car and may crash.', u'Since this product is designed to be used as a 3-Step system, along with the cleaner and carnuba wax, this review was also posted under the Step 1 and Step 2 products to help anyone who may miss one of the products...I have a 1970 American Motors AMX with the bittersweet orange color which I bought new and drove until 1983.', u'Since then, the car has set under the carport, uncovered, collecting dirt and grime.', u'Its only use has been to serve as our cats \"perch\".', u'You can hardly imagine how tired and run-down it looked.', u'Truthfully, I was skeptical... but a friend who does auto detailing told me to give the Mothers three-step product a try.', u'So based on that recommendation, I ordered it through Amazon as it was not available locally.', u'I was excited to see what the old buggy could look like.I soon found out one thing - This product takes a lot of rubbing.', u\"After rinsing the car off (it doesn't run yet, so I just sponged it off) to get the worst of the grime off, then set to work with the cleaner.\", u'I also purchased the Mothers 4 Paint ball and used that in my drill along with lots of rubbing with some old fluffy athletic socks.First coat done: and the results were nothing short of amazing; However, some haze was still visible.', u'So I applied a second coat of cleaner.', u'That one went on much easier, and following the final hand rub, the haze was gone.I wish that I could post photos here for you to see the before and after - Only photos could demonstrate what this product, preceded by the step 1 cleaner, and step 2 sealer has done.Since the car had been virtually unprotected for nearly 30 years, and exposed to wind, temperature extremes, and blowing rain and snow, there were quite a few surface rust bubbles peeking through the paint.', u\"They still remain (after all, it's an old car with completely original paint).\", u\"But that's okay - The Mothers three step product did its job and I am a happy camper.The only recommendation I would have is to buy two bottls of cleaner if you have a car in a similar condition.\", u'I ran short and had to buy a second bottle.', u\"In my mind, that's a small price to pay.The system is also available as a complete 3-step kit called the Ultimate Wax System.\", u\"You can save a few bucks on shipping to buy it that way.Happy Waxin'... &lt;>&lt; Item arrived when promised, and was well packaged.\", u'I like the way this wax goes on, and it does leave a beautiful brilliant shine on my car.', u'It does require a little extra effort to get that sweet look.', u'Great wax!', u'Hazed over in about a minute and came off really easily.', u'Non-oily and gives a great shine.', u\"It didn't stain any trim pieces either.\", u'Plus it smells great like all the other Mothers polishes/waxes/detail sprays.', u\"After the rain I'd usually have dirt on the sides and on the back.\", u\"After doing all 3 steps and going through a day of rain, those pesky black rain drops weren't on the back or splash marks on the side.\", u\"the dirt didn't stick.\", u'Works well.', u'I have been using Mothers for 6 years to wax my Honda Ridgeline truck and Audi A4 Cabriolet.', u'I do the 3 step process a couple times a year and then just reply Carnauba wax as needed.', u'This gives my car & truck a great finish and the paint still looks brand new on both!', u\"I reviewed the other Mother's products and like I said before you cant beat this price.\", u'I bought steps 1-3 and the claybar.', u'Once my products run out I will buy this again.', u'Ease of application and removal leaving a beautiful, durable shine.', u'I have detailed high end cars for years and this is a great product for the price.', u\"Mother's is a name to trust when you want excellent product quality.\", u'They over achieve.', u'Mothers car wax and polish are the best car care products i have used.', u'If you care about your cars paint i recommend buying 3 Mothers Ultra Soft Microfiber Quick Detail Towels, MOTHERS California Gold Car Wash and doing the three step polish and wax twice a year.', u\"I WAX THE CAR/MOTORCYCLES ALL THE TIME AND I RATE THIS LIQUID WAX HIGHER THAN MEGUIAR'S THAT I HAVE USED FOR YEARS.\", u'YOU WILL LIKE HOW IT GOES ON AND BUFFS/SHINES UP SO EASILY.', u'GREAT FRAGRANCE TOO.', u\"I used the Mother's 3 step process on my C6 Corvette.\", u'Easy to apply and wipe away.', u'Each step has a different purpose and I noticed a nice clean deep shine by the time I finished step 3.', u'I was a bit skeptical and had tried different carnauba waxes in the past.', u'But this 3 step process has given my car the best shine to date.', u\"I'm a believer!\", u'This product works and smells amazing, however only use this product if the paint is entirely clean, if not use Mothers Cleaner Wax instead as it cleans and protects in one step.', u'this is a really good wax.', u'it gives a deep gloss and shine.', u'It goes on easy and comes off easy without flaking.very good value.', u'This product shines like no other!', u'Goes on easy, comes off easy.', u\"I've used every wax out there this one is by far the best.\", u'I use it on my new MazdaSpeed3.', u'It keeps my car looking amazing.', u'Water beeds for more than 3 months and I cover my car daily and wash it ever week.', u'Good job mothers!', u'Oh, by the way I use the three step system.', u'This one works the best.', u'Very good product, goes on easy and more important comes off the same way.', u'Easy to use by good old elbow grease if not using a DA machine.', u'Do not hesitate to purchase.', u'IMO, much better than that product that starts with M and beads water nicely.', u\"I am already on my second bottle and here at the big A I don't have to go to circus town (WM) in my car.\", u\"I've used many other 'over the counter' brands from Meguiar's NXT, GoldGlass to Eagle1 Nanowax and none of those products comes close to Mothers Pure Carnuba Wax when it comes to deep, reflective shine and ease of use.\", u'Period.I started using this product and noticed the difference right away.', u'Seriously, this is the most underrated wax on the market.', u'Anyone with a black car should give this wax a shot and I will make a bet that you too will see the difference.', u'Even my coworkers saw the difference right away.', u'Just by switching to this wax.', u'They commented that it was \"brighter and really glossy\".This wax does provide a very nice, reflective shine.', u'Very easy to apply and wipe off.', u\"You won't be disappointed with this wax.\", u'Other waxes (especially those synthetic polymers wax) Such as NXT requires that you wait at least  20 minutes for the wax to dry before you buff it out.', u'Even then, they still show signs of \"smears or streaks or oily residue\" on dark colored cars.', u'This carnuba wax dries in no time.', u'By the time you apply the last coat, you can start buffing out the first panel you apply the wax on.The shine is just simply amazing.', u'The smell however is not.This is one of the most underrated waxes out there.', u'Do yourself and your car a favor and get this wax.', u'(See comments for pics!)', u'Great stuff.', u'I use Mothers ultimate wax system and it brings back very aged paint.', u'I would recommend this product.', u'I used this as step 3 of the 3 step process which has as step 1 the Gold Pure Product and the Micro-Polishing Glaze as step 2.', u'This step is the hardest of the 3 and takes the same amount of time to do as steps 1 and 2 combined.', u'You could probably just use this on your clear coat finished vehicle and get excellent results.', u'The wax is pretty thick and it takes some effort to apply and some sustained effort to remove.', u'When you are finished you will have a smooth, shiny, mirror-like finish which is gorgeous.', u'Be prepared to dedicate an entire afternoon to do all 3 steps.', u'On my Mercedes SLK roadster it took 2 hours and I am very happy with the results.']\n"

probably weighs twice the weight of the gun it replaces.', u\"It's got an air pressure release valve to purge any trapped air.\", u'The rubber hose is longer than most and that helps getting in those hard-to-reach places.', u'The tip snaps securely on the zerk fitting and the hose end fitting is adjustable to get a secure connection on the zerk valve.', u'And the one-handed operation of the squeeze handle is a delight to use.', u\"I just finished using it to grease the spindles and wheels of my riding mower and it worked great.This has got to be the last grease gun you'll ever buy.\", u\"You'll thank yourself every time you use it.\", u'After a couple of cheap grease guns, I opted for this better one.', u\"It's definitely heavy duty, worth a few extra bucks, quality throughout.\", u'Comes with everything I need.', u'This is the one I pick up every time I need a grease gun.', u\"The quality of this tool is very good and it hasn't fallen apart or given me any issues yet.If it does I will update my review accordingly.My only regret is that it's not made in the USA.\", u'For the pump:-Solid construction.-No problem loading the grease tube.-Gives out good pressure for injection of grease.For the coupling:-Had a real hard time pulling the coupling away from the zerg fitting.-I would replace the coupling.', u\"This thing seems extremely well made, even if it isn't made in the USA.\", u'I had a cheap gun before this and blew the seals on the second use.', u'This pumped grease into some well rusted fittings with ease.My only complaint is the hose fitting that attaches to the zerks.', u'Yes, it is a 2 piece design as many have mentioned which is both good and bad.', u'If you have easily accessible zerks that need a lot of pressure, you can screw this on and use both hands to pump.', u\"However, large u-joints can be a huge pain as I can't get anything in to tighten the fitting.\", u\"I found I had to keep making adjustments then sticking it in the joint until I found the perfect setting where it fit on the zerk but didn't lose grease.\", u\"However, there were a few joints where I was unable to find this balance and couldn't get them to take grease.\", u'I will have to buy a different hose to get them all.', u'I received from Amazon and put it right to work.', u'I installed a Lithium Cartridge from the top, screwed on the whip hose, primed it, and went to work.', u'I found it locked on the the grease fitting well and pulled off the fitting with a firm tug.', u'It did not lock on like another reviewer found.', u'So far so good.', u'I have owned other Lincoln models and have not had any trouble with them.', u\"I'm a shadetree mechanic, so figuring out how to load this thing was an adventure.\", u\"The instructions are ok, but as I have ZERO experience in using/loading one, it was quite the mess - not the fault of the product, it's all me.\", u'Once I got it all loaded up, it worked flawlessly.', u\"Great pressures delivered into the driveshaft zerks for my '98 Land Rover, and required little to no pressure on the handle to deliver it.\", u'This is a high quality grease gun and FAR better than all of the less expensive ones I have purchased at auto stores and Wal-Mart.', u'I threw away my other grease guns after trying this one.', u\"Can't say anything bad about the gun -- well constructed and built to last a lifetime.\", u'However, I see what people are talking about with the instructions.', u\"They're not really instructions.\", u'No parts labeled, nothing but a drawing of the unit itself, and another small diagram showing the spring release pulled back and locked.', u'Other than that, the instructions literally consist of one 107-word run-on sentence that leaves you scratching your head.',

      "[u'I have two vehicles, both of which have headlight covers which were getting cloudy and yellow.', u\"The first is a 11 year old Jeep Grand Cherokee and the other is a 7 year old Subaru Outback.The Jeep's headlights were by far the worst.\", u\"I honestly though my night vision was starting to go, because I couldn't seem to see the road when I was driving at night.\", u'Then I noticed that my headlight covers were quite cloudy, so most of the light was either being blocked or scattered.I tried the headlight restoration procedure, and tried it again.', u'I spent about a half hour rubbing each lens, and the net result was only a very slight improvement.', u'It is hard to tell, but looking at the lenses, it almost appears that there is as much cloudiness and yellowing on the inside as on the outside.So the Jeep effort was a failure.', u'I ended up replacing both the lenses.', u\"It cost a few bucks, but at least my night blindness seems to be cured.The Subaru lenses weren't nearly as clouded, and it was more of a light haze over the front of the lens.\", u'There was no yellowing or discoloring.', u'The product worked great on this vehicle.', u'I spent about 10 minutes on each headlight, and they now look very close to new.', u'If you look very close, there is still a slight amount of haze, but nothing like when I started.', u'And I am not sure if I just gave up too soon, or if that haze is on the inside of the lens.=== Summary ===So I am happy with the results on the Subaru, and would recommend it based on that vehicle.', u\"The Jeep was a disappointment, but to be fair, I don't think that anything was going to work on those headlight covers.The stuff takes a bit of effort to use, but nothing too bad.\", u'The abrasive pads could have been just a bit bigger, but they were OK to use.', u'Too much bigger and they would have been too large to work around the contours of the headlight.I have treated two vehicles from the contents of the kit, and there are at least two more treatments left before any of the contents start running out.', u'Upon opening the kit, my first thought was that I had just paid for three pieces of emery cloth and some car wax, but the two spray bottles seem to have some positive effect on the polishing.', u'The yellow tube seems to contain something very similar to a car wax, with a little bit of polishing compound mixed it.In short, for the price, I was happy with the performance.', u'If you own a vehicle with basket case headlights like my Jeep, forget it...just replace them.', u'My headlights were only slightly hazed at the top of the plastic cover.', u'All of these products really do the same thing, remove the top layer of plastic and recondition it.', u'This works with hand pads and you get decent results, but if your haze and discoloration runs deeper into to the plastic, you will probably need a 3M or McGuire kit and a drill.', u'For anything light this stuff works great and I can see a big difference before and after.', u\"I'd guess with one treatment and a lot of elbow grease 90% restored.\", u\"Not bad for 15 bucks.The real problem for me and part where this product didn't totally fix it was the swirl marks from an idiot that detailed my car and did slop work with his wheel.\", u'This did help a little with that but if you look real close you can still see the swirl marks.', u'Oh well.. maybe after some more sanding and the next treatment... this saved my yellow headlamps!Really recommended.', u\"has been 2 months now and they're still going strong!\", u'(2003 Ford Sport Trac) I was able to get 3 vehicles headlights restored with this product.', u'All 3 were starting to frost over or go yellow(ish).', u'With about 20 minutes on each car, I was able to make the headlights look brand new.', u\"You gotta put a little back into it, but it's well worth it.\", u'Considering the cost of new headlights this product is worth every dollar!', u'In a few years when the headlights look dull, I will buy this kit again!', u\"I waited awhile before doing this review to see the long term results.This kit worked very good when used on a 2008 model vehicle with hazy light covers.The covers ended up looking better than they were when new, but the effect doesn't last.I have had to redo those light covers about every three months in order to keep them looking good.The procedure is not very involved and just takes a little time and effort to bring the look back.I guess once that showroom shine is gone you just have to keep at it in order to keep things looking good.Thanks to Amazon.com for this offering.\", u'Works exactly as described.', u'A note to the wise: take extra time on the first (#1) sandpaper step.', u\"Go over the entire surface of the headlight (and in my experience the direction of sanding didn't make a difference at all, so don't sweat it) multiple times, washing the dusting of plastic off between each sanding.\", u'This was not in the instructions but helped me immensely.', u'If you do not wash the plastic film off after each sanding the sanding becomes less and less effective.', u'Also useful was rinsing off the sandpaper after each sanding to get the grittiness back.', u'Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with this product.', u'This will take some elbow grease, but WELL worth the time and money.', u'Makes the headlights looks brand new.', u'I did this for my mother-in-law and the thought I had replaced the headlight covers altogether because it turned out so well!', u'Take your time, follow the steps, this will work great for you.']\n",

which once flew off of my car while I was on the highway even though it was properly installed.The installation is a snap and the performance is what you'd expect.\", u'These make good contact with the windshield on my car.', u'How long they will last remains to be seen.', u\"Unless they deteriorate rapidly, and they don't seem like they will, this is a sound buy.\", u'I have found that, during the past months of driving with these on my car, that there are no spots that are not well covered by the wiping capability of these.These snap on easily, and it takes only a couple of seconds now for me to get the old wiper blades off my car and install these.For a long time, I went to the dealership and bought wiper blades just so they would put them on for me.', u'I also paid more that way, and spent time going there.', u'Ladies, if any are reading this, these snap right on.', u'If I can do it anyone can.', u'I have installed a different brand that took more time than these, but not all brands work equally well.', u'Actually, these work better than the ones I get at the dealership, the ones that carry my car brand.', u\"Those become loose and don't grip the windshield fairly fast.Anco wiper blades never seem to lose their traction on the windshield.\", u'They last a long time.', u'Here, any rubber part is quickly oxidized by the hot Florida sun, and in the case of wiper blades, causing streaks on the windshield.', u\"Some brands don't fit against the windshield snugly either, again,causing streaks.\", u'I change wiper blades about every six months, so getting these was good timing.Anco wiper blades not only go in quickly and easily, but the contour is springy and they hold against the glass tightly.', u'They seem to last a long time.', u'This is my preferred brand.', u'I easily installed this product on a 2002 Ford Explorer.', u'It was easy to do and thus far I am pleased with its performance.', u'It sweeps away rain without streaking or smearing.', u\"It doesn't whistle or lift and appears to be solidly constructed.\", u'Good wiper blades are essential to safe driving.', u'These seem to be above par both in ease of installation and performance and I recommend them.', u'I got Anco Contour blades for my 2001 Volvo S60.', u'The blade fits properly on the wiper mount.', u'They snap nicely into place.', u'Ocasionally, I have hd blades which do not fully/snugly snap on to the wiper arm.This blade performs very well.', u'It moves smoothly across the windshield, and is virtually silent.', u'It clears all the rain/water with no smearing or residue left.I would highly recommend this product.', u'The Anco Contour wiper blades fit fine on our 2006 Scion XB.', u\"The fit isn't as tight against the windshield as I would have liked although there is a nice wide arch.\", u'Since clear swiping is more important in our hot, humid, rainy climate, than freeze or snow control, I might like these better if I lived up north.', u\"Of the three I've tried most recently the ACDelco would be the clear winner, followed by the bosh and then the Anco.\", u'There was some smear from the rain, especially if it was a day where rain was mixed with mud from the road.', u'these are okay but not great.', u'I have tried at least 4-5 different beam wiper blades on our cars.', u\"I've never found much difference between them except with installation.\", u'As for functionality, the same is true of this brand of wiper blade.', u'It works well and does a good job clearing water.', u\"Like other beam blades, it sucks water from the vertical edge of the driver's side windshield back into your field of view.\", u\"Otherwise, there's no skips or streaks left behind.\", u'The biggest differenced I noticed with this brand is that it was a bit louder and occasionally squeaked when working, especially in very light rain or with a semi-dry windshield.', u'These ANCO Contour Wiper Blades are easy to install and work as well, or better, than the previous set that we used on our Chevy Caviler.', u\"Installation was very easy when following the simple instructions, taking less than 5-minutes to do both sides (different size blades on the driver and passenger sides my Caviler so be sure to check and order the correct blades).The blades worked well, leaving the glass streak free with each pass.Highly Recommended!CFH It's managing full contact with windshield, no streaks.\", u\"It's heavy duty for snow and may get one yet this year.\", u'I like the way it make full contact but no horrible friction noises.', u\"I'm pretty impressed with these blades.\", u\"I'm a long-time Bosch user (particularly fond of their ICON blade line) and these compare favorably with the Bosch right out of the box.\", u'Very easy to install, and they feel well-built.No streaking or chatter at all.', u\"They are a bit noisier in operation than the Bosch, but it's not a huge difference.\", u\"No lifting when using them at highway speeds.I can't speak to the longevity of the blades as of yet, but will update the review should the lifespan be notably shorter (or longer) than the ICONs.\", u'So far so good, and I definitely would recommend these.', u\"I've had my car for almost 7 years and in that time I've replaced my front wipers at least once a year.\", u\"When I thought about the last time I replaced my rear wiper, I realized I hadn't...ever.\", u'When I went to remove it to replace it with theANCO Contour Wiper Blade, it practically fell apart in my hand.', u\"It was definitely past it's useful life and ready for retirement.\", u\"The ANCO blade was easy to install, it just snapped on and because I live in the Pacific Northwest it didn't take long for some rain to appear for me to test it out.\", u\"The blade hugs the window and didn't leave streaks or miss any areas.\", u\"It also glided smooth and even when the rain let up it didn't squeal on the dry surface.\", u\"Overall I'm pleased with the performance of this wiper and the price is very competitive.\", u'I replaced the worn out Bosch Clear Advantage wiper blades on my 2003 Dodge Ram 1500 with these ANCO Contour wiper blades.', u'These blades install very quickly just like the Bosch blades.', u'Just pull off the old blades and snap the new blades into place.', u'It literally took me about 1 minute to replace them.', u'It took me longer to get them out of the packaging which is a plastic container that is a little difficult to open.', u\"I did notice that they have a very strong plastic smell but that's not an issue once they are installed.\", u'It just stunk up my whole house when I first opened them.', u'They fit perfectly and they were nice and secure.', u'So far they give a nice clean and streak free windshield.', u'It poured down rain the first day that I put them on and I could see perfectly.', u\"I haven't had a problem with streaking skipping at all.\", u\"The only downside is that they don't look as nice as Bosch blades.\", u'Bosch blades are shinier and more modern looking.', u'These blades are duller looking and have a more industrial look to them.', u'So it really just depends on what you are looking for.', u'If you are installing on a fancy car and care a lot about appearance then you way opt for a different brand.', u'If performance is you main concern then these blades might be a good choice for you.', u'These were easy to install but with full disclosure here: I watched as my very mechanical husband gave them a once over and popped them right on.', u'I on the other hand, went and got him after not knowing how to install them myself.', u'Another disclosure; for some reason, I can never install windshield wipers so this is nothing new and not unique to these particular wipers.The wipers are nice with a heavy-duty bar which made the pair that was on my car prior, look cheap in comparison.They work well and fit snuggly to the window.', u'They have repelled water even in the recent Spring downbursts that we keep getting here in the South.They seem to be very good quality and should hold up for quite some time compared to the obviously cheaper in quality ones that came on my car.', u'These are great blades made by Anco.', u'They are beam style blades that hug your windshield.', u'They leave a streak free shine and are great in the rain.', u'They are easy to install and work great.', u'I can say these are comparable to the Bosch brand blades, and would recommend these highly.', u'5 stars.', u'This is a nice beefy wiper blade.', u\"It's much heavier duty than the OEM blades on our Mazda.\", u'The blade surface is sturdier and it has a heavily sculpted airfoil surface on top that helps to add positive pressure to the blade and provide better wiping action.These blades took about a five-Mississippi to install (one-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, three-Mississippi, four-Mississippi, five-Mississippi, done!', u').The price is reasonable, the quality is outstanding, and the installation was simple.', u'Winner!', u'I was soooo....happy to see these here on Vine.', u'I had a set IDENTICAL to these in every way, how they are made, what they are made of, the contour, THIS brand, THIS actual Blade, on my conversion van and sold it and just had another brand of wipers on the car.', u'I love these.', u'The contour of them make them hug the windshield and keep it crystal clear with just one pass.', u\"I also noticed that when it was an icy windshield these didn't freeze to the window like most do.\", u'It was almost as if they had their own little antifreeze coating.', u\"I live in Iowa and even today we are getting another 8 inches of heavy wet snow and it's nice to know that these wipers will handle the load.\", u'I had them on the van for about 2 years and they still worked like the day I put them on.', u\"Can't wait to get them on the car... After 2 months of heavy use these still go strong (no stripes).\", u\"After a cold winter with lots of ice on a windshield every day I'd expect the rubber blade to deform but nothing like that has happened.\", u'Good product for the money.', u'In my area we have a high degree of temperature change and seasonal weather.', u'Heavy ice under snow is not uncommon in the winter and cold damp nights with high daytime temps during the summer months is the norm.', u'Windshield wipers take a real beating to say the least.', u'We have two trucks, an F-250 Ford diesel and an F-150 Ford.', u'With hauling our horses and other farm related work, the dust, weather and miles are a test for any wiper blade... the ANCO Contour blades pass that test.', u'I replaced one of the 22 inch blades on the F-250 and one of the 20 inch blades on the F-150.', u'The \"Kwik Connect\" installation was easy.', u\"They form a tight fit against the windshield that doesn't faulter with highway speeds.\", u'On the other side of the vehicles I used a $30.00 premium wiper blade.', u'The ANCO blade has proven itself to be superior in all areas.', u'I highly recommend the ANCO Contour wiper blade and believe it to be one of the best blades on the market.', u'We got the universal-type wiper blade rather than the blade with a connector designed especially for our car.', u'That means that the connector looks a little conspicuous -- bulky and out of place -- compared to the one on the old blade.', u\"It's not a big problem, but when there is not much to differentiate different replacement wiper blades, it may be a reason to try to get a version designed for your specific car.These wiper blades were easy to attach, and so far work fine.\", u'The studies I have read say all wiper blades tend to last about the same amount of time.', u\"It's hard to say how long these will last, but so far, so good.\", u'fits my car perfectly, works perfectly, was easy to install.', u'The best measure of a wiper blade is that it does what it is supposed to do, when it is supposed to do it.', u'This Anco contour 22\" wiper blade installed easy with just a snap.', u'Removes morning frost quickly and cleanly, and works well in heavy, thick, white rain especially with the big drops that are hard to see through.', u'Will have to wait until later to try in the snow, but expect excellent results.', u\"I had to change my old man's very old rear wiper blade...\", u'I believe they are the OEM they looked very ancient and beat up.', u'I decided to order and try out a Federal Mogul wiper blade (Anco).', u'I have had great experiences with other Federal Mogul product (Champion Spark plugs, Wagner brake pads, Fel- Pro Gaskets etc.)', u'They make ZERO sound against the windshield, and they remove 100% of the water with each swipe.', u'Also if anyone was curious their made in Mexico.', u'Cheers!', u'Anco C -20-UB Contour Wiper Blade-20\" is a great product.', u'It does the job royally.It has replaced a highly obnoxious, noisy ,loud old blade on my truck.', u'It is very easy to install and comes with the necessary hardware.', u'It also has increased my visibility,and calmed my nerves as the screeching from the old pair really got to me.I love them and would highly recommend you try them.', u'Thanks.', u'Anco Contour Wiper Blade (22\", UB for standard wiper arms)I\\'ve used Michelin Radius, Rain-X, Bosch Clear Advantage, Trico Neoform and AC Delco Clear Vision frameless wiper blades in the past.', u\"I've found that they can last a decent amount of time, about 2-3 years before exhibiting chattering or streaking.\", u'Sometimes if they are well maintained/cleaned, they can remain streakless for several years.', u'But the same problems with the inexpensive framed blades apply to these: the rubber blades can hold a form/set in cold weather and start chattering, and they can wear out.The big advantage to frameless blades is the reduced number of pivot points/joints and moving parts.', u'Essentially there is the linkage, and a piece of spring steel to provide the flex in the blade.', u'The Bosch, AC Delco, Michelin/Pylon, and Rain-X blades are all similar except the Trico Neoform has a great locking mechanism.These Anco Contour blades have a soft \"wing\" built into the wiper to provide downforce at speeds and reduces chattering or vibration.', u\"Other than that, there's nothing really different about the Anco Contour blades.\", u\"They're well-made and easy to install, and seem to perform the same as other frameless wiper blades.Overall: 5/5 stars, good design, has an asymmetrical and flexible wing design to reduce lift and chatter at high speeds.\", u'I just put these in my old hauler hatchback for large shopping runs.', u\"I didn't expect this to be a good time to review them because it wasn't supposed to rain for a while.\", u'Out of the blue, though, we had a couple of storms so I have been able to test them in the wet.These replaced a set of old fashioned multi-part wipers.', u'I already have a couple of other modern one piece style wipers on other vehicles.The wiper was a tad longer than the one it replaced and bumped the other wiper blade when I snapped the arm back down onto the glass from installing.', u\"I don't think it will be a long term problem though.Installation was dead simple.\", u'The supplied extra clip was not needed for my Mazda vehicle, and there are no convoluted instructions to puzzle or hinged parts to get it to lock in place and stay on.', u'I have had nightmare wipers in the past and these were really simple to install.These wipers worked very well, leaving no creases on the window, though they do remove water quickly and get noisy fast once the windscreen is dry.', u'I tried them after spraying the windshield with a watering can to see how they work when there is a lot of water involved.', u'The wipers stood up to a pretty heavy load of water being dumped on the windscreen.Right now being the near the end of a hot spring we have a ton of pollen falling off of trees and blowing around.', u'So overnight we have a fine sprinkling on the windshield which catches the sunlight and makes it hard to see.', u'So despite it not being a typical rain season the wipers are still needed on a daily basis.', u'They work a treat at removing the pollen off the windshield.Overall I like them and they work well.', u\"They aren't the most attractive though; some other ones have more streamlined covers for the clip fastener area for example but they work well and are very easy to install.\", u\"I didn't notice any whistle wind noise traveling at speed which I had noticed with other wipers.Hopefully these will last the hot summer and see me through next winter.\", u'Not bad at all.', u'This is the third brand of this type of wiper (frameless) that I have used and these ones also perform better on my car than the standard framed type of wiper.', u'Usually at highway speeds, standard framed wipers (or worse yet -jacketed winter wipers) start to lift a bit or do not maintain full contact with my windshield, but these low profile wipers keep full contact along the full length for a clear windshield.', u'There was no squeak or stutter, and they were able to keep up with a full-on heavy rain, which some wipers do not seem to be able to do.', u'The drivers side wiper on my car covers more than 50% of the wipered area and the windshield is at relatively low angle which causes many wipers to lift or lose contact at highway speeds.', u'This wiper works as good or better than any standard type wiper I have used.', u'Installation was a snap.', u'I do not live in an area with snow or ice, so I cannot on this wiper in \"winter\" conditions.', u'I would rate the performance comparable to the ACDelco Clear Vision.', u\"Only time will tell if it lasts as long as the Bosch Icon wiper that I still have on the passenger side after more than a year (the driver's side Icon wiper lasted about a year).\", u\"The Icons are the best I've ever used, but they are almost double the price.\", u'Regardless of brand, I will not be going back to the old standard type of wiper.', u'I have been using a jointless wiper blade ever since it became a popular replacement for the factory jointed type that is usually pre-installed when you buy a new vehicle.', u'The ANCO C-19-UB Contour Wiper Blade - 19\" fits the bill when you need to replace or just want to upgrade to a better performing wiper blade.', u\"Got this just in time to coincide with persistent rainy weather we've been having in my state.\", u'Snow on the other hand is a different story, no way for me to simulate that kind of weather event.', u'It also worked well with frost accumulation on the windshield.', u'It wiped away the frost smoothly, with no kind of hesitation or drag while in the wiping motion.My thoughts:Performance: the jointless type ANCO C-19-UB Contour Wiper Blade - 19\" is contoured better to \"hug\" your windshield with minimal resistance and pressure points.', u'This translates to better wiping ability thereby enabling you to see better in inclement weather.', u'Since it is jointless, this type of wiper gives you uniform wiping pressure, eliminating the pressure points or the \"streaks\" that you see across your windshield as it moves across the windshield.', u'The curvature of this wiper is aerodynamic, it will prevent a lift-off of the blade even in high winds.Installation: it took less than 10 minutes to install the ANCO C-19-UB Contour Wiper Blade - 19\" without using any of the adapters for the wiper arm of my vehicle.Very satisfied with how the ANCO C-19-UB Contour Wiper Blade - 19\" has performed.', u'It is in the middle of the pack as far as price is concerned compared to other jointless name-brand wiper but gives you an awesome wiping performance.', u'Highly recommended!', u'These look striking similar to the Bosch Clear advantage wipers, springy curved blade that hugs your windows.', u'I did have a bit of trouble getting them on, for my car I had to take off the pre installed adapter on the Anco Contour wiper but after that it fits well and does a good job at clearing the window.', u'Time will tell on their longevity.', u\"Admittedly, I'm not a huge fan of car accessories; in fact, I've been known to go years rather than months in between wiper replacements.\", u\"But, last year I tried out some new blades and was really amazed at the difference so since that time, I've tried to make a point of keeping wipers in good working order.The ones on the current vehicle were a bit more than a year old but in Florida the harsh sun and daily thunderstorms combined with love-bugs, leaves, pollen and consuming sunshine means wipers get put through the paces.\", u'Mine were streaking up a storm and even more irrating...squeeking.', u'I HATE squeeking!So, this came up for review; arrives promptly, takes about 1 minute to install (literally).', u'No squeeking, no streaking.', u\"I'm a happy camper!\", u'I got one of the 16\" Anco wipers to replace a worn-out rear wiper on my 2002 Subaru Forester.', u\"I received the UB model that included an adapter; however, I didn't need it.\", u'Installation was very simple, taking only a few seconds once I had perused the instruction sheet.', u\"It seems to be a solid connection.To my recollection, this is the first Anco wiper blade that I've had.\", u\"It appears to be well made, and I'm looking forward to using it.\", u\"It was drizzling rain this morning when I went out shopping, and the wiper blade worked well to conform to the slightly curved hatchback glass and wipe it without streaking.Of course, the real test is how well the wipers work in six months or a year from now, and if I have any problems, I'll note them.\", u'But my initial impressions are very good.', u'These ANCO Contour wiper blades have a different design than traditional blades - this one piece design is supposed to help improve the way the blade conforms to your windshield.', u\"It also means this has more rubber and less metal in the design, so there's a stronger rubber smell, as some reviewers have noted.\", u'I found this easy to install (I got the 18\" and 20\" for the front blades on my Escape).', u'The blades seem to work fine and I am pleased with their cleaning job so far.', u'I will have to see how well the rubber holds up over time...', u\"I haven't had any major problems with wiper blades before with the different brands I've used so I expect that these will last a normal amount of time and at some point just need replacement when customary wear leads them to start to streak.\", u\"I'm not convinced that these are going to perform substantially better than lower-priced blades since I've found that inexpensive blades usually perform just fine, so if you already use more inexpensive blades that are performing in a satisfactory manner you may not need to spend more to upgrade to these contour blades.\", u'In determining if this design is better for your car you may have to consider which model of vehicle you have and the climate where you live.', u'These blades installed without a hitch on my old Grand Caravan.', u\"I hadn't used single-beam wiper blades before, so this was something new for me.\", u'They work fine.', u\"But so has every other wiper blade I've ever used (at least when new), some of which only cost a third of what this product does.\", u\"I don't know that these will last three times as long as other wiper blades I've used (including Anco's 31-series), and am guessing that the others represent a better value.The supposed benefits of this design?\", u'\"Resists corrosion & freezing\".', u\"Can't say that I've ever had an issue with either corrosion or freezing with any of the blades I've ever purchased, and I live in northern Utah, where we get a lot of cold and snow.Anyway, they work fine.\", u'If you feel a need for this blade design, go for it.', u\"But I'm pretty sure I'll be back to the cheaper blades next time, since they work just as well for me.\", u'Hands down the best windshield wiper I have ever owned.', u'The thick durable rubber blades wipe the windshield dry at every swipe.', u'It not only wipes the windshield dry with every swipe in a heavy rain storm, but it cleans the windshield of dirt, bugs, and most other debris.', u'The wipers were very easy to install and come complete with numerous different attachments to fit most any wiper assembly.', u'When I first installed theANCO C-26-UB Contour Wiper Blade - 26\", (Pack of 1), I was impressed by how easily and quickly it snapped into place.', u\"My previous blades were easy, but I didn't trust that they would stay on because of a weak latch.\", u'This blade was very secure, so I proceeded with the second blade.', u'Again, very easy to install and it snapped comfortably onto the windshield arm.', u\"Because it wasn't raining, I used the car sprayer to test the blades and after a few squirts, I had a clean and sparkly windshield with no hiccups on the windshield.\", u\"In the rain, these work great, too, but I haven't had the opportunity to test them on a snowy day.\", u'I can definitely recommend these blades!', u'This Contour wiper blade is an upgrade for a beam blade or the older conventional wiper blade.', u'My car has the conventional wiper blade.', u'The contour blade was a breeze to install.', u'I just removed my old blade, added the attachment to the contour blade and plugged it into the wiper arm.', u'Took about 2 minutes.Once on, the new wiper worked great.', u'There was no smudging at all, the blade wiped the window perfectly clean on each pass.', u\"I'll definitely replace my old blades with this type when it comes to replace them.\", u'The ANCO Contour is a decent curved blade providing an effective sweep.', u'The \"UB\" part is the one that works with the flat cane-shaped connector, as opposed to the \"OE\" blades that comes with three adapter clips which appear to fit rectangular original equipment brackets on some vehicles.', u'The compatibility list has been updated more accurately, but it is best to check before placing your order.Though not the most aesthetically handsome clip to look at, the \"Kwik Connect\" contour blade is easy to install and costs about as much as any other full blade assembly.', u'I like it.', u'As it turned out, only 1 front wiper blade was available for my car.', u\"So I took it as an opportunity to do a side-by-side between this wiper blade on one side of the windshield, and the dealer's stock wiper blade on the other.The Result?The side with the stock wiper blade streaked like crazy, while the side with this this Contour looked like it was squeegeed clean -- no streaks, no nuffin -- just a nice clear windshield.Why Contour?The name says it all -- the wiper blade's plastic spine is bendy, so the blade conforms perfectly to every car's unique curves and nuances.\", u'Perfect contact.', u'Perfect wiping.', u'No streaks.', u'And nary a drop left behind.', u'OH!', u'So THIS is how wiper blades are supposed to work -- duh!Hands-down, my fave wiper blade.', u'Now I just need to get a matching pair.', u'This has to be one of the easiest do-it-yourself car maintenance projects.', u'It took about 30 seconds to snap off the old wiper & clip on the new one.', u\"The hardest part is figuring out how to take off the old wipers & that's easy too.The installation instructions are pictorial; no words.\", u'There are no buttons to snap; just slide the metal \"J\" shape clip over the wiper mechanism.The wipers work well; no streaks & no blowing around at highway speed.There is something about the rubber these are made of; they stink to high heaven!', u'I was sneezing & my nose was running while putting these on so I guess I had some kind of allergic reaction?', u'It took a good soap scrubbing to get the smell off my hands.', u\"I've never experienced this with wipers before.\", u\"It really doesn't matter once they are on the car since I don't spend time sitting on my windshield & the smell has dissipated after a few days.\", u\"First of all, I've wrestled enough with wipers in the past to appreciate when the installation of a wiper is really easy.This wiper popped on in so fast that I was sure it wasn't right.\", u'But it held tightly.', u'This wiper is on the right side of my mini-van and kept the windshield super clean and clear.', u'There were no streaks, it moved things like seed pods and other gunk that falls on my windshield easily.So two major pluses: it installs easy and does a great job clearing the windscreen.A recommended wiper!', u\"This is a review of both the driver's side wiper (21 inches) and passenger side wiper (18 inches).New windshield wipers are like new sneakers: the old ones may still be fine, but the new ones make you feel like you can fly.\", u'Same with these ANCO C-21-UB and C-18-UB Wiper Blades.', u\"My old wipers weren't crying out to be replaced, but these new ones have passed with flying colors and no streaking.\", u'We\\'ve had rain about 80 percent of the time since I received these, so at least as new wipers they\\'re more than passable, they\\'re nice.Our car has the \"hook\" type connectors for which these are primarily designed.', u'I had more of a problem taking the old wipers off than the 2 seconds it took me to \"click\" these on.5 out of 5 stars for nice, quiet, no streaks, and easy installation.', u'I recommend these with no qualms.', u\"I don't think I have used the same brand of wiper blades twice in the last couple years.\", u'I have tried ACDelco, Rain-X, AutoTex and Bosch.', u'And my reality is that they all worked well in my California neck of the woods and that they were all easy to install.', u'This Anco Contour blade was no exception.Where the Contour stands out is, well, with the contour.', u'Instead of a design that promotes symmetrical airflow over the blade, Anco has developed a design that looks like a spoiler on the back of a car to channel airflow and promote good contact between blade and windshield.', u'The result is a blade that works well and looks much nicer than any other aftermarket I have tried.', u'This is not the largest wiper on the market but it sure looks impressive in the package.', u'It was quick and easy to install.', u'I like the unibody design over the old multi-arm style.', u'The rubber is pliable and contours to my large curved windshield so I get a clean swipe every time.', u'The Anco blade seems sturdy and rugged.', u'You need that during the snow storms.', u'I\\'m using this 18\" wiper blade on the driver\\'s side of a \\'93 Plymouth Voyager.', u'It was easy to install, clipped right in, and fits well.', u\"For the few times it has rained it did a nice job with no smearing or streaking.I'm testing this in May when the weather is nice and there is no ice or snow.\", u'I will update after a few more seasons and use during the winter.', u'We got a single ANCO contour blade to review, and we reviewed it side by side against a new regular ANCO (non-countour) blade on the other side of the front windshield.', u'I own a Subaru Forester.', u'The Contour blade was slightly clearer and slightly quieter.', u\"Both were just as easy to put on and remove.I'm 44 and have been driving since I was 16.\", u'In those years I definitely learned early on the value of using a good quality windshield wiper.', u\"After all, it's a relatively cheap part which can help prevent a quite expensive (and harmful) accident.\", u\"So definitely I would say if you're currently using a cheap windshield wiper blade that it's well worth upgrading to something good quality.Do you need to go from normal ANCO to the contour ANCO?\", u\"Again, I would say it's worth having the best you can get.\", u'This is about seeing the road in front of you in an already slick situation.', u\"You've got enough else to worry about in a thunderstorm or snowstorm.\", u\"You don't need to worry about being able to see the road on top of everything else.I'll update this when both wear out, to give notes on the durability of them, but I assume both will have the normal range of durability.\", u'We installed this wiper blade on our 2006 Civic.', u'As we learned in the past, wiper blade installation instructions leave a lot of room for improvement.', u'The instructions for the ANCO Wiper Blades were no different, the tiny drawings are hard for us to decipher.We usually forget how to take the blades off the Civic and resort to  watching Youtube videos.', u'After finding the appropriate video, we finally installed both blades...and I might add, installation was a breeze once we knew how to take the old blades off.So far the blades are performing as expected.', u'I will update my review if my opinion changes.', u'These wiper blades are easy to attach and they seem to be strong enough to do a nice job.', u'Most wipers now have gotten better and cheaper really quickly.', u'I seem to replace them a lot more often now than I ever have in the past.', u'This is not bad.', u\"Like these ANCO's, they are easy to attach, are good performers, and they seem to be relatively inexpensive.\", u\"These ANCO's are all of that.Feel confident that there are good wipers that work well, and that attach very easily.\", u\"ANCO's Contour Wiper Blades offer good contact to your windshield, streak free wiping, and easy installation.\", u\"I've had the joy of purchasing contoured wiper blades for several different vehicles.\", u'Truth to be told, they do not always work best on windshields that have a heavily curved shape.', u'I got these Anco blades to go on a minivan, which had a mostly level shape all the way across.Easy is simple, as it is with most wiper blades.', u'The UB series comes with connectors for vehicles that may not have to same style.', u'Within a few minutes, the blades were installed.', u'Under normal conditions the blades appeared to have good contact.', u'My first tests were just with windshield washer fluid, but then came the perfect test environment...an entire day of rainy weather.Contact was good across the entire blade.', u'As I noted earlier, if you have a windshield that is more curved you might have an issue on the ends or in the middle of the blade depending on the degree of the curve.', u'But overall, the contact appears to be very good and the pressure applied to the windshield was very good.', u'Wiping at slow or high speeds produced a good, clean wipe without streaks.', u'Overall, the Anco contoured blades our great performers!', u'I live in Florida and drive A LOT, we are also plagued with bugs.', u\"This is hands down the BEST wiper I've ever used, and I've used and reviewed many over the years.\", u'In fact just the morning I was driving and a couple of big juicy bugs hit the windshield.', u'A little wiper fluid and this thick, strong, and very effective wiper completely cleared the remains from my windshield.', u'I will be buying and recommending these to everyone I know.', u'These are inexpensive and simple blades, but nothing to write home about.', u'Having tried a bunch of different brands of blades lately, these give me the least confidence as they have less spring tension out of the package, are larger to catch more air at high speeds, and seem to streak at times.', u\"It's hard to say what the long term effects will be, because sometimes blades end up accustoming themselves to your car over time, but these just strike me as fairly mediocre.Unlike other reviewers, I sort of like that fresh manufactured rubber smell.\", u\"I've never tried an Anco wiper before, but with all the rain lately, not was a good time to give the brand a proper try.\", u\"The Contour was super easy to install, and snapped on with less work than any blade I've tried (Silblade, Michelin, etc.).\", u\"I replaced only the driver's side with Contours on two cars, and so was able to compare the performance directly.\", u'In both cases, the Contours were far superior.', u'They hugged the glass and swept off liquid cleanly, and were essentially silent even when the glass was not very wet.', u'It was enough of a difference to make me want to replace the other blades as well, even though they are not very old.The one thing I have yet to test is long-term durability.', u'If there are any issues with this, I will update the review.', u'Would you believe we live in Seattle and had these on our truck for 3 weeks before we could say more than \"they were easy to install\"???!!!', u'Well today the weather finally cooperated and gave them a true test.', u'So not only were they easy to install, they preformed well in a spring squall, wiping cleanly with no streaks.', u\"The blade that holds the wiper seems well made & sturdy, unlike other more flimsy styles I've tested recently.\", u'They are flexible and contour well to the curvature of the windshield but are much wider and more substantial than my last set.', u'This seems to hold the wiper more firmly to the glass for a clean sweep.', u'I plan to get another set for my car before my fall road trip.', u'Good wiper blades are such a cheap investment for driving safety and there really is no excuse for not having the best possible visibility under whatever conditions may be around the next bend.', u'Do us all a favor and order yourself a pair today!', u\"The C-18-UB Countour Blade fits my husband's 2006 Honda Accord on the passenger side.\", u'The ANCO C-22-UB Countour Wiper Blade fits my 2010 Honda Odyssey on the passenger side.', u'Installation was super quick.', u\"I didn't need to use adapters or anything.\", u'Just make sure to tug it to make certain it is on correctly.', u'Otherwise, it will come flying off.', u'Ask my boss about that story.The blade itself is a single unit.', u\"This gives it a low profile and it's very attractive.\", u'The blade is curved to wipe the windshield evenly.', u'The technology really works.', u'I tried it by having my daughter spray the windshield with a water hose head set on sprinkle, like rain.', u\"I didn't see a single streak.\", u'Great wiper blade.', u'These are really nice wiper blades, no streaking or catching up.', u\"They were easy to install, just clip them on.Came with a good set of instructions, but we didn't need them.I would recommend these ANCO Contour Wiper Blades.\", u'I love these ANCO Contour wiper blades.', u\"They're easy to install, work well and last quite a while.\", u\"I've found they work no matter the weather conditions, and in winter or summer with no problems at all.\", u\"I've had these last up to a year with regular use, and probably could have gotten even longer out of them.\", u'Recommended!', u'We used the ANCO C-26-UB Contour Wiper Blade - 26\" to replace an existing blade on a Toyota Corolla.', u'Installation was easy and the blade is nice because it just snapped into place.', u'It feels very secure and the contour shape makes for a nice windshield hugging design that removes water and debris on the windshield evenly.', u\"It's so nice having this replacement after the last blades that were getting old and left lines and streaks if the windshield was at all dirty.\", u'These move nice and smoothly, touching the whole surface.Recommended for an easy to install, windshield hugging design which does the job well.', u\"The Anco C20-UB Contour wiper blade fit perfect in my husband's 2001 Dodge Ram PU truck.\", u'It also looks a thousand times better.', u'It performs really good from the get go.', u'The contour hugs the windshield nicely without streaking, smearing, or skipping.For the price, these blades are so much nice looking and better performing than the cheap stock blades.', u\"I've had great luck with inexpensive Anco wiper blades over the past 10 years.\", u'My mechanic swares by Anco blades as good inexpensive wipers that do the job, and I tend to agree with him.', u\"While I've had the contour wiper blades on my 2004 Subaru Forester only a short time, I already like them.\", u'First, the quick connect system (found on other Anco blade wiper blade models as well) makes installation easy.', u\"Second, I notice no streaks with these blades, which sport Anco's Dura-Klear wiper element technology.\", u'Finally, these are thick, substantial looking wiper blades at a reasonable price.', u\"The one piece design supposed to resist corrosion and freezing-I'll have to wait for next winter to see if that is the case.\", u\"First, Amazon's does it fit is great to use; helps make quicker decisions.\", u\"These are a little bit thicker than what was on the car making them more noticable - not a deal breaker and probably I'm the only one who will notice (at least they aren't pink...).\", u'It fits snug to the windshield.', u\"Unfortunatley, we've had unusually warm, dry weather for May so far here in Seattle so I had to test it by spraying it with some water.\", u\"We'll see how it holds up in a downpour...\", u\"Since it is outside the car I don't notice any bad odor.\", u'These are good quality wiper blades than work well and seem quite durable.', u'Installation is a breeze.', u'I recommend these wiper blades for anyone in need of a good quality replacement.', u'These wiper blades are pretty good.', u\"I'm using them on my Lancer.\", u'They were very quick and easy to install.', u\"It only took about a minute to remove my old blades and replace them with these.I've been using them for about a week and so far they work really well when it rains.\", u\"I haven't had any issues with streaking or missed spots.As far as looks go, these blades are pretty basic.\", u'They are very plain.', u\"If you're not looking for anything fancy then these blades should work just fine.I would recommend these wiper blades.\", u'I managed to get the wrong blade for my car by not looking it up properly.', u\"This shouldn't be a problem since it is very simple.\", u'Just put in the year, make and model and Amazon will tell you if it is right.', u'I have the correct one at this time and it is the same blade with a different attachment mechanism.', u'Both seem to be very well constructed and hopefully will last through the snow and rain.', u'In the past year or so, I have put these wipers on twocars,  a 2005 Toyota Sienna, a 2003 Mazda Prot&eacute;g&eacute;.', u'I have the Bosch version on a third car, and find these comparable.', u'I find that the curvature of the glass makes a difference in the relative performance of the wipers,  on the Sienna, which has a pretty flat glass surface, they work a little better than the standard type wiper, but not much.', u'On the smaller cars, which seem to have more curvature near the top and bottom of the windshield, the contact is better across the whole swipe than with my regular blades.These are much easier to replace than the old style, the hardest part for me was getting the old ones off, I actually had to google the directions.', u'Honestly, the fact that these

skips or squeaking.', u\"Although it is now spring, this type of blade has an advantage over the multi-piece blade designs in that ice can't get trapped in the arm, so winter driving is much easier.\"]\n"

happy with this towel.', u'Very absorbent material.', u'Not like most microfiber materials.', u\"If you work with your hands and have calluses that microfiber acts like Velcro with then rest assured

easily around sharp obstacles like chrome badges.\", u'This thing is HUGE!', u'its drys very well, and does not scratch the paint finish, for the price it beats all!', u'It is a decent quality towel for the price but the towel seems to bleed the blue when I wash it with other microfiber towels.', u'I am sure there are better quality drying towels but at this price it is hard to beat.', u\"I've been using using leather chamois, the absorber, and microfiber for drying the car but this towel is really remarkable.\", u'It sucks up the water and holds it very well.', u'In fact, it retains water so well that it is hard to wring the water out to continue drying the car.', u'Although you can dry a whole car with one towel, i bought two to get the car really dry.', u\"It's a good investment.The one con is that this towel snags VERY EASILY.\", u'probably due to the effective waffle weave.', u\"i've been able to reduce snagging by re-training myself to blot the car dry, instead of wiping/dragging across surfaces.\", u'Yes, it SUCKS up a lot of water.', u\"I didn't pay attention to the 9 square feet when I bought it.\", u'So when I opened the package, 9 square feet is a lot of towel.', u\"I've been using terry cloth for years and have gotten worn out.\", u'I bought this to replace them, and it does its job well.']\n"

      "[u'I give my 4 year old car a full cleaning treatment at least twice a year.', u'About a month ago when I just finished my pre-winter car cleaning ritual a neighbor walked by and ask me if it was a new car shining in my drive way.', u\"That's when you know the wax did its job well.Meguiar Gold Liquid Wax not only does a great job, it is easy to work with if you follow simple steps below:WASHI wash the car first using a detergent designed for car washing, as it removes the grime better.\", u'I use microfiber towels to wash.  What you use to wash makes a big difference, a good micro fiber towel makes the job go faster and it does a good job with the smallest amount of effort.BE COOLI wash either in the shade or in the evening when the sun is not strong.', u'Strong sun will dry out the water too soon and working with dry finish can lead to small abrasions.', u'Hot paint finish is also easier to damage.', u'So I make sure the car is cool while I am working on it.', u'I wash the top of the car, then the bottom of the car.', u\"I don't want dirty water streaming down on the clean portions.DRYThen I dry the car which helps remove whatever dirt might have remained on the car after the wash.\", u'I use more micro fiber towels.', u\"I like Costco's micro fiber towel bag, for $10 you get a big bag of high quality towels of just the right size.CLAYI check the car for any dirt that the water did not take off and clay those areas.\", u\"I don't clay the entire car, just the areas where I see imperfections.WAXI apply the wax to another micro fiber towel, spread it on a small portion of the car (3 feet by 3 feet), then wipe it off with another micro fiber towel.\", u\"If you let the wax sit too long it will become difficult to buff off, that's why working on small areas is better.\", u'If I drop a towel, I move on to the next one.', u\"Even tiny dirt particles you can't see will scratch the paint surface.\", u'I try avoid getting wax on plastic parts.', u'If I do get it on the plastic parts, see \"back to black\" described below.BACK To BLACKThe final step is to apply Back to black solution to plastic parts of the car.', u'It makes the plastic look new, and it is not harmful to the painted surfaces.', u'Back to black solution effectively removes any wax residue you might have gotten on to the plastic parts, it also takes care of the sun damage to the plastic.This procedure takes me about an hour.', u'I love riding in a shiny clean car plus I always get great value back when I sell my cars.Meguiar\\'s Gold Wax is one of my \"secret\" weapons to make a four year old car look like new.', u'I recommend it!Ali Julia review I just had my car at a car show and used this to touch up several places on the car.', u'The shine the liquid wax gave was compatible with the paste wax already on the car.', u\"The Mequiar's products are among the best.\", u'I use this ONLY as a touch up as I still prefer the paste wax for a deeper coat and longevity.', u\"This is great when you don't want to spend a lot of time or your just need touch ups here and there.\", u'Very easy on and off with an excellent shine when done.', u'So far has lasted and makes cleaning the car easy.', u'The key to making this wax stand out is doing the prep work1)Washing2)claying3)Polishing4)WaxingThe wax is best applied on a cool surface.', u'If you can comfortably lay your hand on the surface of your vehicle for 30 seconds with out burning your good to go.Apply a very thin coat and buff off after about an hour.', u'You can get about 14 applications or more from this bottle.', u'very easy to use and provide great protection and shine.', u'I see no reason to use separate polish as I did a comparison and this alone provides same level of shine as using Meguairs #7 polish.', u'Plus this is a wax and provides protection.', u'While you must have your paint cleaned and prepped, GC liquid wax is no doubt will amplify the gloss even more.', u'Application is easy on and easy off.', u'Just avoid from hitting the plastic trim.', u'Comes even easier with the use of DA.', u'longevity is somewhere around 1-3 months.', u'then you need to re-apply the wax.', u'one bottle could easily cover 10 medium sized cars.', u'This is great wax!', u'It truly deserves the Gold Class name.', u\"I use this after the Meguiar's Ultimate Polish.\", u'I also have migrated to a 6 in buffer/polisher.', u'I used to do all of my polishing and waxing by hand, and with the buffer, this turns out great.', u'I have an 89 LeSabre that is Black Sapphire in color.', u'Before using the polish/wax combo, it looked more like a darker blue.', u'Nothing really deep.', u'After polishing and waxing, it now looks like the black in black sapphire.', u'It looks great in the shade, as it should and looks beautiful in the sun.', u'There is a nice deep, glassy color, and I am pleased with the results.', u'The water also beads very nice, too.', u'I love taking care of my vehicles.', u'I have used many expensive, imported products over the years.', u\"However, Meguiar's keeps winning me back with their incredible offerings.\", u'They are of high quality, effective, easy to find, and affordable.', u'However, take the affordable off.', u\"I'd use their products, if they were 3x the price because I've used products that cost that much and are less effective.Meguiar's Gold Class Liquid Wax is another example of that experience.\", u\"Meguiar's effectively markets this wax and who doesn't love using something called Gold Class that comes in beautiful packaging?\", u'However, it is not smoke and mirrors.', u\"Inside the bottle is a very good wax that will greatly enhance your paint's finish, while providing all-important protection.For optimum results I strongly encourage you before you apply Gold Class, to clay your car, clean with a paint cleaner (i.e.\", u'Deep Crystal Step 1), polish with a pure polish (Deep Crystal Step 2 or #7 Show Car Polish), and then apply this wax.', u'The results are truly remarkable.', u'Again, I have used many waxes to top off my detailing, and Gold Class is one I keep going back to.', u\"It's one of my favorites and one of the best.To maintain your shine, remove loose dirt and contaminants with Quick Detailer, or Ultimate Quick Detailer.Meguiar's keeps delivering the good stuff, and I'm a fan.\"]\n"

u'I wanted to explain how I decided to purchase this Jump-n-Pack so my review is long Sorry!I have used many Jump Packs & all have worked OK in the past until I purchased a Larger Diesel Truck that is.', u'This truck is a Mitsubishi FE140 with a 4Cyl Turbo Diesel engine.', u'It has two Batteries & we have two inverters, a fridge etc that run of the truck.One day we was shopping but when we returned to the truck no start because we left lights on OOPs.', u'Now the store we were at had a normal Name Brand Jump Pack like you see in most stores.', u\"Unfortunately it didn't work at all.So we called roadside Assistance which was to say the least an adventure.1.\", u'After over two hours of waiting & mis-communications a nice guy in a Honda that was barely running showed up.', u'I was literally laughing as he pulled up with his little yellow light on the roof.', u'His car was barely running.', u\"All he had was a smaller Clore Jump-n-Carry which didn't do any better than the other one we tried earlier.\", u'He gave up eventually2.', u'Roadside Assistance Apologized & said they would send a more appropriate vendor to jump our truck.3.', u'Next a truck larger than ours showed up so now Im thinking we are in good hands.', u'Well he had a direct connection plug to use his truck to jump us which did work but not before trying for 30 minutes.So after all this my BoyScout side said I would never be left in this situation again so I researched many Jump Packs on the web.', u'Finally finding the Clore JNC660 which had a few reviews about it jumping even Larger Tractors which have multiple batteries.', u'I decided I had nothing to loose so I purchased it during a Xmas Lightning deal thinking how is this Jump Pack going to work on our truck being this inexpensive.', u\"I purchased knowing Amazon would back it up & also thinking I could use it on our boat if nothing else.I also made sure I was getting the newer model based on some reviews saying they didn't receive the updated model.\", u\"At first all seemed well so I didn't get to test it out since I wasn't going to run batteries down purposely.\", u\"Finally there was a day it happened the truck didn't start because something ran the batteries down.\", u'So I pulled the Jump-n-Pack out thinking I hope this works.First of all it had nice long reach cables which was awesome since all others I have owned or tried had very short cables that required holding the jump pack up over batteries.', u'Next I hooked it up went to cab tried to start & it fired up almost instantly to my amazement.I have now had to use the Jump-n-Pack multiple times on this truck because the Fridge was running batteries down very fast due to defect.', u'The Jump-n-Pack has not failed one time & has had to jump this truck not only once on a charge but 4 times in same day.I know it is It is just a simple Jump Pack but it does the job so well all my vehicles will have one soon.Update 08/19/2013:I have been using this for quite awhile now & it has never let me down yet.', u'I have used it to boost my Fuso Turbo Diesel truck multiple times, Our Land Rover, Lawn Mower as well as our Boat.', u'I will purchase a backup second one when Amazon puts it on sale again.Now there is one negative to mention.', u'After using it quite a few times I have noticed the cables getting skinned from the way it winds them up.', u'I have found you must take extra care to wind it up just right to prevent this from happening.Update 09/12/2013Today Amazon put this on sale again so true to my word I have purchased a second one.I also wanted to add to my review I recently had to replace both batteries on my Truck because they both had dead cells.', u'This is even more testament to this Jumper because it was still able to get my truck running even with two bad batteries that were low on water also.', u'The Clore JNC660 has a decent 425 Cranking Amps, which is the amount of *sustained* amperage this battery provides.', u'The 1700 Peak Amp specification may sound impressive, but \"peak amp\" is just that -- the maximum (or peak) -- but not necessarily *sustained* amperage -- the battery supplies.', u'Bear in mind that when picking out a battery, \"cranking amps\" is more important than \"peak amps.', u'\"I\\'ve owned the JNC660 for two years.', u\"I've used it a handful of times and it's always worked.\", u\"There are a few things that are noteworthy:- Somewhat High MaintenanceWhen stored, the battery has to be charged up once a month (even though it's never been used).\", u'If the battery IS put to use, it has to be charged up after every use.', u'Failing to do either of those things will cause the battery to degrade -- and I found that out the hard way.', u'My battery now charges up to only 70%.- Terminal Cap Tethers Break EasilyThe plastic terminal cap tether break very easily.', u\"One of mine has broken every though I've handled it with care.- No Air Compressor And Power InverterI would recommend having anall-in-oneunit over having a separate charger, air compressor, and power inverter.---The JNC660 is expensive, but it works very reliably.\", u'Just be aware it requires regular charging or the battery capacity will diminish prematurely over time.', u'Have a truck with 6 year on the factory battery.', u'I know any day it will meet its end.', u'Bought one of these for several reason.', u'!', u'being the truck 2. being my ride on lawn mower battery seems to get weak during the winter (live in Florida so need it year round) and three I attend several sporting events and my friends always

      "[u'The good:  Easy to assemble/disassemble.', u\"It's super light weight and it won't scratch.\", u'It locks and has a great read for getting the snow off of your roof.', u\"Ice scrapers are always handy to have, especially one on a long shaft to help with the windshield.The bad: seems very cheap and I can't see it handling heavy snow accumulation.But I do like the concept and it is safer for your car's finish than a houshold broom.\", u\"It is nearly Christmas and we haven't had a huge snow yet.\", u'Tomorrow...ugh.', u'Anyway, I like that this has both the snow broom and scraper together.', u'It feels very sturdy and the ice scraper works really well.', u'When it snows tomorrow, I will update whether or not the broom part works as well as I believe it will, judging from the sturdy construction.I do NOT look forward to using this.Stay warm!**update.', u'It works wonderfully well at pushing snow off of my FJ without me feeling like I am using some abrasive broom on the truck I love.The blade seems to have fallen off of the ice scraper end, which is a bummer.', u'Maybe the ice was too thick the last time.', u'We has a 10.5\" snowfall last week so I had a perfect opportunity to try this out on my CRV that sits outside.The good is it does do a much more efficient job than a brush and is much kinder to the paint.', u'I like that the foam head unscrews and snaps onto the handle for compact storage in the car and there is a hole in the scraper so it can hang on a nail or hook.', u'When using the scraper end it is best not to have the foam head attached.The bad/inconvienent is the foam head screws on and when using it the head can start to turn if you put counterclockwise pressure on it.', u'The telescoping handle takes a bit of fiddling to get it into the lock position.Aside from those issues it is so much easier to clear snow off my car especially the high roof on my compact SUV I will continue to use it and would recommend with reservations.', u'I lived on Lake Ontario for 8 years.', u'Lake effect snow was a daily topic of news from November to May.', u'So I moved further south to get away but the snow followed me.', u'Luckily not as much.But when snow does cover my minivan, which is parked outside at all times, it is a pain to quickly remove snow before going on my way.', u'The Snow Joe is a good way to reach far, clear without scraping and scratching and get the snow off of the roof.The Snow Joe collapses down and detaches from the head.', u\"The handle snaps onto the head for storage.The only issue I had with it was that the handle didn't always stay tightly screwed onto the head and the handle was sometimes hard to lock into the telescoped position.Overall, the foam is nice and gives me confidence that I won't get scratches and the telescoping handle reaches the top of the van and middle of the windshield.\", u'The ice scraper on the other end is okay, pretty standard.', u'When home and the car is out and gets snowed on, I usually use a broom to clear it, though I think that might not be great for the paint.', u'(When away, I use a brush/scraper combo thing.)', u'So I was pleased to try this out.', u'It makes light work of pushing the snow off the car, and I love it for that.', u'Additionally, for scraping, the long handle makes scraping go a bit easier in places.', u'I think I am going to be very happy to have this this winter.', u\"Four stars because it's just not excellent... the foam end will wear out and as another reviewer said, the scraper end ends up at an odd angle, relative to the foam end.\", u'But I like it.Pros:1.', u'Long length and large foam rectangle means you can push snow off quickly.2.', u'Long handle was also helpful for scrapingCons:1.', u\"Blue foam end is probably just the right thing, but it doesn't seem durable2.\", u\"The two ends should be at the same angle, but are at 90 degree angles.Overall, I found it to be a helpful tool, and I'm happy to have it this winter.\", u'I normally hate snow, but after getting this, it was pure torture waiting for the snow to come.', u'Thankfully, it finally did.This is everything the manufacturer says it is.', u'I have grip problems because of disc issues in my neck, yet I was able to easily able to unscrew the handle to its full length.', u\"Because I'm short, I needed the full length of the handle to get the roof of my Hyundai Sonata.\", u\"This Snow Joe made it very easy to clear the entire width of the car's roof from one side, without having to walk around to the other side of the car.\", u'The ice scraper worked very well on my windows, and I was able to clear both sides of the windshield (again, from one side of the car, without having to walk around to the other side of the car).So, if I like this Snow Joe so much, why did I mark it down a star?', u'Because the handle gets COLD -- FAST!', u\"It wasn't horribly cold for these parts (around 30 F), and I normally wouldn't bother with gloves if I'm just clearing snow from the car without having to go anywhere.\", u'While it took less time than it usually does to clear the snow from my car (probably less two minutes to scrape the windows AND clear the snow from the rest of the car), by time I was done, my hands were painfully cold -- even though I had been storing the Snow Joe in my warm house.', u'Be sure and wear gloves when you use this, even if you normally \"don\\'t need no stinkin\\' gloves!\"', u\"Driving with snow on your car or truck is not only dangerous it's just dang rude.\", u'Eventually that snow will fly off, or worse, ice over and fly off creating unsafe conditions.', u\"Shoot, in many states it's illegal to leave snow piled on your car/truck so, use this to push or pull it off.The blue blade is foam, no sharp edges, no way to scratch up your vehicle.\", u\"It's light weight and when disassembled is rather compact.\", u'I say disassembled because to remove the blade, you have to unscrew it.', u\"I expected that it would fold, but the unscrew thing isn't a problem.\", u'The Snow Joes easily pushes heavy, wet snow off the roof, hood, and trunk of your car and works better than brooms.', u\"It's made with a durable reinforced molded polyethylene foam head and prevents scratching.\", u'The telescoping handle extends up to 49-inch providing maximum reach with no strain on the operator.', u'The snow joe snow  features an ice scraper as well to assist with ice buildup on your windshield.', u'This product breaks down to a convenient size when not using and offers a two year full warranty.', u'To extend the snow broom for the first time, screw the pole to the foam head.', u'Twist the bottom portion of the pole to the left and pull hard.', u'You will only need to pull hard the first time you use the snow broom.', u'To lock the lower pole in place, simply twist the pole to the right.', u'I have a 3/4 ton truck and like these snow removers.', u'This one would have gotten 5 stars if the handle was longer This Snow Broom is an improved &#34;snow pusher&#34; for 32 cents more than I paid for my smaller version (Sno Brum Snow Removal Brush) several years ago.', u\"Thanks to Amazon Prime's free shipping, the new, larger &#34;broom&#34; actually cost me $8.63 less than the old one.\", u'And, it has an attached ice scraper.', u'This is absolutely the best automobile snow removal tool ever invented.', u'You get a clean car with no scratches.', u\"You should order one right now so you are ready for next year's snow.\", u'Wish I would have gotten one of these years ago.', u\"We've received more snow then usual here in NEPA this past season and this has helped clean the cars off much faster (with excessive snowfall) then a scraper or regular broom.\", u'Telescoping handle is very nice and the scraper on the other end is great as well.Def worth the investment.', u'I live in an apartment, so if it snows, my car is getting covered.', u'This \"snow broom\" is sturdy enough to pull even heavy, dense snow off my car without scratching it.', u\"It even retracts and folds up neatly so that it doesn't dominate the floor of my backseat area.\", u\"It's a little awkward for heavy scraping, but it does work.\", u\"If you have to park your car outside when it snows, this is a good way to get an overnight's worth of accumulation off of your car.\", u\"Due to lack of current garage space one of our vehicles is staying outside in the winter for the first time and here in the North East we're going through a particularly bad cold, blustery spell.\", u\"It was with great relief that I received the combo ice-scraper and snow 'broom' as, up until now, we haven't needed one and so we were without.The telescopic stem comes clipped to the foam broom for storage and easily screws into the base for use.\", u'On one side is a firm plastic scraper and the other has the hardy blue foam rake.', u'Our car was covered in snow about three inches deep and it was quickly dispatched by using the sturdy but soft broom part.', u\"It was so cold that the wipers were frozen to the screen and after using the scraper to get off the ice I used it to pop up the wipers so they would work.There's no chance of damage from using the scraper or the broom and really it's a simple fact that without it I would not have been able to drive my car.\", u'So for that, and the super low price, this is a five star product.The fact that it can be folded back up for storage is just the icing (hah!)', u'on the snowy cake.']\n"

u\"There always seemed to be one thing that most people agreed they didn't like.\", u\"But realizing that in the last twelve months I've but over a grand into my two vehicles and following a real mess at a local repair shop where they argued with me about what I was told initially and even my paperwork, compounded by the fact that although it was a free service I was tired of going to my local auto parts store to have codes pulled.\", u'I decided it was time to break down and make a decision.', u\"Here's my perspective on these tools.\", u'First, don\\'t buy the \"Swiss Army Knife\" types.', u'If it seems like a gimmick, it always is.', u'Secondly, (and this is what I was hung up on) forget OBD I!', u'For most of us, our days of driving anything pre-96 is over.This tool (CP9580) had everything that I wanted.', u'It pulls, displays, and clears all generic OBD II diagnostic and trouble codes from all cars and light trucks regardless of make and model sold in the US.', u'(Though all scanners will as well.)', u'It does support ABS codes for the \"Big Three\" domestics.', u'This model is USB updateable which is still a rarity for some reason.', u'(Although I have yet to update it.', u'I will post again when I do.)', u'This is kind of gimmicky but the \"code connect\" feature give a list of a number of top reported fixes based on trouble codes.', u\"However I'm not a huge fan of this since a code error from one system can obviously be a symptom of an issue in another system.\", u'Finally it displays live data which I figure has already paid for the cost of the unit for me.', u'Following my less than pleasant experience referenced above with my 05 Lancer, about a week after receiving the car back I got another check engine light AND my idle was a little fast (but no code).', u'The according to the live data the throttle at idle is registering slight pressure.', u'The unit does not require batteries to operate, however it will work and store data when not connected to the vehicle with 4 AAAs.All in all, this unit (thus far) seems to be a well rounded device that is geared towards the weekend repairman.', u'It will save you hundreds if you have a few basic tools, the internet, and a little know-how.', u'Great scan  tool for \"DIYs\" and \"Pros\"!', u'Easy and simple to use, gets right to the problem you may be having with the car.', u'Turns off the check engine light if no major problem is found with the click of a button.', u'Great buy!!!', u'Will save you money and pay for itselfe in just a few uses.', u'Can\\'t go wrong with this \"scan tool\".', u'Very easy to use and so far seems to do everything that it is supposed to do.Several reviews indicated problems with connecting/printing to and from the computer.I had no problem connecting or printing.Just follow the instructions.', u'With everything now days spitting out codes, I needed something that reads them.', u'This more than fits the bill.', u'It covers everything I need, and more.', u'It is small, has the code connect, easy to work the menus.', u'Plus it was on sale when I got it.', u'A friend of mine recommend ACTRON to me.', u'He has had a CP9190 Elite since they first came out and never had any trouble with it.', u'I have yet to have any issues with mine and I have used it on several family members cars.', u'It kept my mother-in-law from getting ripped off at a shop.', u'I am very pleased with this tool.', u'I recommend this tool for home use.', u'The only draw back is that it does not work  with OBD1 on older vehicles.', u\"I can't tell you how hand this product is.\", u'If you work on your cars you can diagnose the component and reset the check engine light.', u'Works on my Chevy truck and BMW.', u'There\\'s a boatload of code scanners to choose from so the question one might ask is: \"Which one?\"', u'The answer, after two days of research and a follow-up day of research after ordering this unit, in the short, this one.', u'Why?', u'Because it hits the middle ground between price and features smartly.First things first, all of the units I checked out had many various negative reviews.', u'To me, negative reviews are very telling as what to expect.', u'The point, all the code checkers have negative reviews, not just this one.', u\"I let negative reviews be my guide to the positive reviews, not the other way around.Second:  Over the last few days, I've had several contacts with SPX's (Actron) customer service to ask sales and tech related questions before buying.\", u'My experience, to a one, each interaction was a positive one.', u\"A positive consumer attitude might have something to do with this point as the folks answering the phones are human also.Third:  I asked a customer service rep about warranty issues regarding online Amazon receipts and was told there's no problem with warranty returns using an online Amazon receipt.Fourth:  I asked about available software compatible with Win 7/64 and was told that Win 7/64 software was expected a couple of months out.\", u'Time will tell on that point.', u\"If you're XP/2000/Vista, 32bit compliant, you'll be good to go.\", u'(As of 14SEP2011, Win 7/64 drivers ARE available)actron.com/downloads/Fifth:  I easily scanned, found and corrected (erased) the error code which caused me to buy this unit in the first place; 2000, Dodge Durango.Details:  The quick start manual is quick and dirty.', u'I was up and running in minutes, not hours.............Batteries are not included.', u\"You'll need four AAA batteries on stand-by if you want to use this unit immediately on arrival.............The comprehensive, downloadable manual (pdf) is a hundred and eighteen pages.\", u\"Wow!............The unit scans many vehicles for Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) error codes.............The unit comes with a six foot tether that's easily connected/disconnected but it don't come with no case.\", u'Bummer.', u'Of course, for seventeen additional dollars plus shipping, you can buy a soft case from SPX.', u\"But they're currently out of stock.\", u'I used an available case I had hanging around the house to give this unit the protection a piece of high-tech gear of this kind deserves.', u'Works great and saves money.', u\"The six foot tether is long enough so one can use the unit while sitting in the driver's seat.\", u\"The code scanner a past mechanic used, had a two foot pigtail and he was stuck under the steering column on a hot sweaty day with me feeling guilty as if I were abusing my mechanic...........You can't download and install available software (Scanning Suite) if you're running Win 7/64.\", u'Double bummer...........Restating, not compatible with Win 7/64.', u'Supposedly compatible with 32bit OS such as XP, 2000 or Vista.', u\"I write supposedly as I haven't check out compatibility issues with any 32 bit OS's...........Unit looks good so it has a high cool factor...........I recommend getting an inexpensive copy ofOBD-II & ELECTRONIC ENGINE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS TECHBOOK (Haynes Techbook)to augment this piece of gear's instruction set...........I also, recommend getting a Cable Extension, J1962m to J1962f, 15ft (144203) if you're wanting to scan from the engine compartment.\", u\"I ordered one that arrived today.If you're wanting a code scanner to keep you away from mechanic/dealership pricing, that hits the middle ground between being a full featured unit that's not, by comparison, overly priced (yes, this is a bit of a pricy unit), my opinion, this is the unit you want.\", u'Remember to offset the price of this unit against legitimate mechanic fees (they have to pay their utility bills also) and the convenience of being able to scan, clear and correct error codes yourself via parts replacement.', u'And if you let friends and family members know you have one of these babies, your popularity index will immediately go through the roof.A final thought, if going on a roadtrip, I highly recommend throwing this unit into your bugout bag as when the \"check engine\" light comes on, you won\\'t have to worry about what the light is trying to tell you as you can immediately pull over and find out what\\'s up.', u'Very cool.Hope the above helps.']\n"

complete the kit.This kit is a great deal because we had purchased a similar hose kit and the exact Sidewinder hose support and paid $60 just for those two items at our local Walmart.You pay not ever need the Sidewinder if you only pull up and dump at the park's dump station but if you leave your RV connected to a septic system or go to a park that has a full hook-up at your camping spot then the Sidewinder is very convenient.\", u'It works by allowing gravity to aid in eliminating waste in the sewer hose.', u\"We didn't buy one of these when we first started RVing but we found that we really did need one of these and consider it a must now for proper drainage.The RV sewer hose rinser works by attaching one end to your garden hose and the other to the sewer hose allowing you to rinse it out without having to worry about getting yourself wet or dirty.The RV toilet treatment drop-ins can be added to your holding tank or your grey water tank.The gloves are just cheap disposable, latex-free gloves but that's all you really need.\", u'This would be a great starter-set for new RV owners.', u'Emptying the black and gray tanks on an RV can be a little daunting for new owners, and

semi rigid.', u\"You can compact it down to about 4' long, which is nice for storage.\", u'You can also stretch it, bend it, and set it to the dimensions and position you want.', u\"Again, this is much nicer than most hoses I've used in the past.\", u'It also comes with good fittings on both ends.', u'The bayonet fittings on the RV side are strong, but not too rigid to attach and detach.', u'Then the service side (that goes into the sewer drain) has a good strong 90* fitting and a male end that fits snugly into the sewer opening.', u'The only thing to watch out for is that the fittings on both ends are threaded on, but not with any hardware or clamps.', u'They are designed to turn and fit into place, but too many turns will unscrew them, which would be a disaster._________________________Sidewinder Hose Support:This graduated support does two things for you: It keeps your dump hose off the ground and it helps to control the slope of the hose for better drainage.', u\"I've used a number of similar supports and they all more or less work the same way.\", u'The key is to match the length of the support to the length of your hose.', u\"Obviously a 15' support wouldn't work very well with a 20' hose.\", u'This set works nicely together.', u'The other thing I like is that it has a rigid plastic clip to snap it back shut.', u\"Instead of a velcro strap that's easy to lose, this clip is built into one of the ends.\", u'Very nice._________________________Gloves:Gloves are pretty much a commodity.', u\"I've used some gloves that I didn't like before, but for the most part all gloves are pretty much alike.\", u\"Luckily these gloves are good and don't give you much to complain about.\", u'One nice noteworthy bit about these gloves is that the package converts into a dispenser that you can stick into your cargo hold.', u\"That's great.\", u'It keeps the gloves in a place where you can find them and it also keeps them from rolling around with some of the unsanitary parts of your dump kit._________________________Sewer Hose Rinse Cap:Utterly useless.Think about it for a second.', u'First of all, your sewer hose is a disgusting thing and nothing short of a drum of Purell and an Autoclave are really going to get that hose clean.', u'If your goal is to rinse it out, then dump your tanks in the right sequence.', u'Dump your black tank first (the source of the real nastiness in the hose).', u'Then when the black tank is completely finished, close that valve and empty your gray tank.', u'The sudsy water from dishes and showers will rinse it out pretty completely.', u'There will be some food particles too, but those are pretty minimal.', u'And if you have an extra gray garden hose for flushing your tanks (highly recommended!', u\"), then you can use that hose to just run some clean water through the dump hose after you finish draining the gray tanks.This cap doesn't do much more than your gray garden hose would though, except it makes kind of a spray pattern at the opening of the hose, which supposedly scours that first few inches of the dump hose more thoroughly.\", u\"That isn't worth the time it takes to attach & detach it.\", u'Plus if you use a public station like Camping World to dump your tanks, the people in line behind you will start chucking rocks at you for holding up the line while you use a gizmo like this.', u\"Bad idea._________________________Drop-in chemical packs:I'm 99% convinced that RV tank chemicals are just a placebo, but I use them anyway.\", u'You can Google the \"Geo method\" to get suggestions for alternate ways to keep your tanks fresh.', u\"I can't help but think that the contents are always going to smell like a septic tank and your best bet is to not keep the toilet valve open so long that the smells come out.\", u\"Regardless though, I agree in principle that it's a good idea to use some kind of deodorizing chemicals.\", u'The problem is that some of the chemicals have their own offensive smell.', u'I like these drop-in packs though.', u\"The smell decent enough and they're pre measured.\", u\"I've used them on two different trips and they don't seem to be any better or worse than the green goo I used to pour into the tank.All in all, this is a great collection of items to help you deal with a very unpleasant reality of RVing.\", u\"Whether you're new or experienced, these items (except for the rinse cap) should satisfy you and help you minimize the amount of time and inconvenience spent in dumping your tanks.Happy RVing!Dave EdmistonModeratorToy Hauler ForumRV.NET Okay, so a bit of background is probably in order.\", u'In our younger years, the spouse and self used to go tent camping but as we aged, sleeping on the ground, dealing with the weather and so forth lost some of its appeal.', u'We opted to trade up to a small travel trailer which provided some of the comforts of home with easy access and set -up when out and about.It was a terrific plan and everything has gone smoothly except for one aspect...sanitation.', u'There are no words to describe my level of hatred and disgust for everything sanitation related.', u\"It's so bad that most of the time I select  a campground based upon the availability to full service showers/bathrooms etc...of course, I hate public showers/bathrooms nearly as much as the sanitation issue so it's been of little help.My solution was to buy disposable everything...especially the hose.\", u\"No, they aren't truly disposable which makes it somewhat expensive as I simply refused to re-use anything after having to dump.\", u'My spouse, a much more practical person, has complained that my buying disposable (ie cheap) products makes it worse since the quality leaves a lot to be desired.When this came up for review it was an absolute no-brainer.', u\"He loves the hose...I'm dubious about keeping one after it's been used but he assures me it will be bleached, rinsed and stored in its very own plastic bag.\", u'Despite my misgivings, he claims this hose is far superior as it has its own support system to help with emptying, a sprayer to help clean a bit more, gloves (we own boxes but still this is nice to have as a kit), the chemical treatment (again, we already have some but as a kit this works well).', u'The really nice thing is the hose and attachments which make this stand out from the rest.', u'This hose is able to shrink down or elongate, it has twisting connectors that make it simple to position and situate, the hose is a good length and sturdy.Spouse was absolutely delighted by this set.', u\"We've bought each of these items independently and spent more so the value seems in keeping especially given the quality of the hose and related attachments.\", u\"Disposing of the liquid waste from an RV (recreational vehicle) is probably the least pleasant part of the camping experience but it's necessary.\", u'This kit contains almost everything that an RV camper needs to do that job in a single, well-thought-out, cost-effective package.1.', u'The tough Rhino Flex sewer hose in this kit compresses to a length of less than five feet but will stretch as long as fifteen feet.', u'Some RVs can store the sewer hose inside a hollow four-inch square rear bumper.', u'This hose will compress short enough to fit into such a bumper.', u'The bayonet fitting on the \"top end\" of the hose fits the waste outlet of the RV, while the other end has a permanently attached 90 degree fitting that uses the included adapter to make a water-tight fit with many modern campground sewer connections.', u'This sewer hose should stretch long enough to work at most campsites, but if more than one sewer hose is needed, this hose must be the last one in the chain.', u\"End caps are also included that seal both ends of the sewer hose when it's in storage.\", u\"Then there's no dribble or drool.2.\", u'The sewer hose support compresses to about one foot or will stretch out to match the length of the fifteen-foot hose.', u'A plastic carrying handle holds the assembly together for easy transport and storage.', u'Using this support to keep the sewer hose off the ground can provide a smooth slope from the RV to the campsite sewer connection to ensure a continuous, efficient flow of the effluent without pooling that can freeze in cold weather and cause backups.3.', u'Anyone, like me, who has tried washing a sewer hose by running water into it from a garden hose can encounter unexpected back spray.', u\"That's definitely not pleasant.\", u'The sewer hose end cap in this kit adapts a threaded garden hose to the \"top end\" of the sewer hose to provide a water-tight connection and shut-off valve.', u'This adapter, which should take no more than 30 seconds to attach, can give the sewer hose a vigorous final cleansing rinse without any unpleasant back spray or contaminating back wash.4.', u'RV toilets and black water tanks are far more sophisticated at reducing or eliminating unpleasant odors since my first motorhome trips more than forty years ago.', u'Even so, sometimes the black water tank needs outside help.', u'This kit contains a \"starter\" package of fifteen orange citrus packets to tame odors and help dissolve solids when necessary.', u'Just drop one into the toilet and flush.', u'Unpleasant odor goes away.5.', u'Although I usually useKimberly-clark 55089 sz; xl, sterling gloves [PRICE is per BOX] to handle RV sewer hoses, this kit includes fifty pairs of large plastic gloves in a handy, plastic stick-on dispenser.', u'Although these \"kit\" gloves aren\\'t as tough as Sterling Nitrile exam gloves they are big enough to fit my large hands and are robust enough for one-time use when handling sewer hoses.In summary, most RV owners will eventually buy all of these items as they realize their need but they may come up short in the interim.', u'This kit is a reasonably-priced package that includes every item necessary for efficiently dealing with RV sewer sanitation issues except a black water tank washing wand.', u'In my experience Camco makes the toughest, most durable sewer hoses in the business.', u\"If you've ever had an inferior sewer hose split and spray its contents, as I have, you'll agree with me that buying the best is a wise investment.\", u'Camco claims to make the \"world\\'s toughest sewer hose.\"', u'My experience with their hoses (and others) supports their claim.', u'This is a kit that contains a $30 hose, a $30 hose support and some extras (disposable gloves, tank drop-ins for odor and a rinse cap).', u'It is everything to get you started if you have nothing...Pros:  The hose comes with end caps to keep drips from wandering after dumping.', u'The hose compresses and stays that way until you need to expand it.', u'The hose support also expands to match the length that the hose is expanded for a given campsite.', u'Plus, it&#8217;s compact, light weight and has a carrying handle.', u'The gloves come in a box that has self-adhesive strips for mounting it to a convenient spot in the RV.', u'The rinse cap has an integrated ball valve to turn the water on/off.', u'It doubles as an end cap if needed.', u'It is easier than trying to rinse the hose out with just a garden hose because you can hold one end of the dump hose up to allow rinse water to fill the dump hose.Cons:  Gloves are nothing special.', u'I prefer better fitting latex or vinyl gloves used for painting.', u'I probably won&#8217;t use the rinse cap a lot because I dump black water first, then grey (soapy) water second.', u'It would be nice to have a clear fitting instead of a white one to tell when the tank has finished dumping, but you can usually tell by sound.', u'The hose does not look as durable as the Valterra hose that I currently have.', u'I&#8217;m not sure how it will handle multiple cycles of expanding/contracting or dragging across concrete.', u'There are heavier duty hoses available for about $15 more.', u'The Valterra hose is made from a spiral metal wire, wrapped in vinyl.', u'The Camco hose does not appear to have any metal in it.I didn&#8217;t try out the tank drop-ins yet, but I will in the next month.Overall, this is a great kit at a fair price ($60) that will get you started with your RV.', u\"The drain hose, support and washer worked as designed but the question for me is storage, I don't imagine the drain hose will fit in a bumper tube, and I don't have a bumper tube to test it.\", u'The collapsible design of the support and hose does reduce the storage size and hose comes with storage caps so it will store in an exterior compartment.', u'This kit thoughtfully comes with disposable gloves and drop ins for the toilet.', u'After testing it on our trailer, I can say the fittings work well, and we had no issues with leaks.', u'This is your basic RV sewer hookup kit.We have a Camco sewer hose just like the one in this kit that we have been using for years.The slant hose guide does a great job of using gravity to keep things moving on down the hose.', u'This is a handy kit, especially for beginners but even life-long campers like us can appreciate the convenience of just grabbing everything you need in one go.', u\"They didn't go cheap on the hose quality either, it is well-built.\", u'The gloves are standard issue gloves, but they get the nasty job done.', u'The citrus drop ins are going to become a long-term use product for us, even when we are out of the ones that come in the kit, I like the simplicity of them and the fresh scent.', u'All in one and appears well made and suits our purpose.Bought product all from one supplier so all things fit easily.', u'When we rent out an RV and go with our kids - while safety of sleeping in campgrounds is one concern, the only other concern is the sanitizing the RV !The rental RV come with very limited set of tools to sanitize and RV and with week long trips that we typically take - it becomes our responsibility and need to maintain it well.this comes with the complete set of stuff required to clean an RV, to drain the sewer into a tank, clean with the drop-ins (orange oil based) which makes it smell clean.', u'We did use this on one of our trips and very satisfied with it.']\n"

EKWP2000 or CAN.', u\"Once the proper protocol is detected, the MS300 is ready to display whatever Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC) the car computer's memory may be holding.It should be noted that:# it

u'It also includes a printed list of over 1000 generic Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC) definitions.', u\"8000 more manufacturer specific DTCs can be found on the CD with more information at the company's own Web site.In my case, I was able to diagnose within minutes the source for the 'Service Engine Soon' warning on my dashboard:P0442 - EVAP Emission Control System Leak (Small)I erased the codes and, if the warning reappears, I will know EXACTLY what to tell the technicians.Given that I purchased this during one of Amazon's lightning deals, the price was right and I feel that I am getting a lot of value out of this little tool.\", u\"The manual's small shortcomings do not compel me to subtract a star so, it's a 5-star device for me.\", u'I am happy I ordered

ordered this one at a very inexpensive price.', u'Comes complete with info about what the codes mean.', u\"If you are a back yard mechanic and would like to know what is wrong with a particular part of your vehicle and don't have the tool and codes to ascertain, then this less than $21 purchase is a must for your tool box.\", u'This worked very easily and googling the codes gave me a quick

for free at a local parts store, or worse...taking your car to the dealership.I do have to say though, I'm glad a code book is included, as the CD that is also included is completely useless.\", u'Do people actually still use mini-CDs???', u\"I guess if you have a tray loading tower PC you'd be okay, but there's no way that thing is going to work on my iMac super drive.\", u\"There are plenty of reviews about what the product can and can't do so I will keep my review very simple.I believe this is an excellent low-cost solution for turning the Check Engine Light off in your vehicle.\", u'If you were to go to a mechanic, they most certainly will charge you more than $17 and the light may appear almost immediately if the problem is not fixed.', u'So this unit essentially pays for itself if you only were to use it one time.I also want to add than I am very impressed with the quality of the tool.', u'The plastic feels substantial and the unit has a nice weight to it.', u'I was expecting it to look very cheap but I am very satisfied with how it looks and feels.The tool is also very easy to use IMOI highly recommend this tool if you want a very cheap option for getting rid of the annoying orange light.', u'This worked perfectly.', u\"Cleared my CEL, gave me codes to search up what my problem was, and it's all packaged in a small, super simple device.\", u'Only 2 buttons.', u\"Easy use.- Plug it into the OBD II connector- Turn your key so it's right before your car starts.\", u\"Don't start your car.- Press enter and done.You can use the other button to scroll through

in our '98 CRV.\", u'Plugged this in to find that no codes had been triggered, our mechanic had just forgotten to reset it last time we took it in.', u'This thing works great to reset lights and what

inst really a piece of finally tuned machinery, it is a brush.', u\"It does what it was meant to and doesn't have any defects or flaws so far.\", u'I like Mothers car products and this one is no exception.', u'I would recommend for tires and scrubbing the wheel spokes.', u'Could also be useful inside the car Very handy to use, good ergonomic design, comfortable to hold and rubber handle  grips well , even when wet.A bit expensive for what it is, but works much better than you used tooth brushes.', u'These brushes came in handy for me when cleaning up a new/used truck, and also when cleaning between the fins of a motorcycle engine prior to painting.', u'If you have show cars, these detail brushes are a must.For those that want a nice clean detailed ride the same applies.They get down in the hard to get to places.Good deal for the price.I love them and would highly recommend these detailbrushes for anyone that takes pride in their ride.Complete Microfiber Towels Car Kit - 2

cleaning only a brush like these can deliver and is highly recomended I use these brushes for my vinyl convertible top, after spraying it with the convertible cleaner that is part of the kitRaggtopp Convertible Top Care Kit - Vinyl.', u'I tried another brush before but it was too stiff.', u'This one is perfect instead.', u'I use two brushes together, one next to the other (the two handles together can fit one hand without problems) in order to make the brush surface larger.All the brushes that are sold specifically for convertible tops have very poor reviews and everyone says that the bristles keep coming out.', u'Instead this does not shed bristles at all.I am very satisfied and I highly recommend this brush set The 3 brushes work well both inside and outside the car.', u'They dust hard to get areas and they help get ride of old wax on the outside.', u'These work well for detailing and cleaning the small hard to get areas when cleaning my truck and cars.', u'Very pleased with these from Mothers.', u'Great for small crevices and the price is right for such a well made brush.', u'Can  be used for other small cleaning around the house.', u'I use these brushes on my car to clean the spaces between the door, fenders, hood and every place wax might not be reachable with a cloth.', u'The brush is sturdy and the bristles are long enough to get to those hard to get places.', u'These are great brushes for tight areas like little corners where the spokes meet the hoop of the wheel.', u'They are actually a little larger than I was expecting, probably about twice the size of a toothbrush.', u'The bristles are stiff enough to actually clean without being too stiff so you have to worry about damaging the finish you are cleaning.', u'Love that it comes with two, I kept one for projects around the house and threw the other in my detailing bag.', u'They are pretty solid, but a bit too short.', u'Now they are quite dirty and the bristles are a bit worn out, so we will see if I can still get some use out of them.', u'a must have for a auto detailer gets into all the nooks and crannys of any car with ease 5 star rating An excellent companion brush to the Mothers Wheel Brush.', u'I use the large wheel brush to clean the wheel face and the detail brush to get between the spokes and clean the inside surface of the rim.', u'I have been using one for the wheels and one for the carpet in my Genesis Coupe.', u\"My wheels are plasti dipped and the brush doesn't harm the dip or remove parts of it which I love.\", u'I like the size of the brush because it fits into my little detailing bag perfectly.', u'These little brushes have allowed me to clean some hard to reach areas on the exterior and the interior of my vehicles.', u'They are comfortable to hold and they are designed well, especially with the little tip on the end.', u'I can wrap a cloth around the end and it allows me to clean small crevices that I would not have ordinarily have reached.', u'On the exterior, I can remove wax that sometimes gets into small linear crevices with the tip of the brush.', u'I bought these for cleaning the nooks and crannies of my rims and also around the emblems.', u'Perfect for the job at hand!', u'These are great detailing brushes.', u'Good firm bristles yet soft so as not to damage anything.', u'They do a great job of getting into cracks and cleaning out dirt or wax.', u'A must for good detailing.', u'Bought these along with wheel brush for my car.', u'These handle the difficult spots and those where the brake dust is more difficult to remove.', u'These are great little QUALITY brushes.', u'Perfect size for small areas and clean up very nicely with the hose for next use.', u'We love them.', u'Seller as fast and efficient.', u'I love these guys for detailing our cars.', u\"They're small (not too small) and can get in just about everywhere and don't force me to try to use my big brushes and towels on fine work.\", u'Especially for doing grills and around windows and what not.', u'Buy them, you wont be sorry.', u'If you are looking to get all the dust in the blower vents and around the buttons on your radio this soft brush will do the job!', u'The best thing is it comes in a pack of two for both of my cars.', u'Good brushes sturdy will last a long time very good quality product.', u'I will buy more of these types of products again in the future.', u'I cannot believe I did not buy these sooner.', u'They are great for cleaning my brake calipers.', u'My calipers are painted yellow on my CTS-V, and always get dirty.', u\"It's very difficult to clean with a sponge.\", u\"But with these brushes, they make them look brand new and I'm quite happy with that.\", u'Primarily intended to be used on automobiles, with bristles which are of medium softness, Mothers Detail brush is not supposed to do any damage to painted surfaces, providing it is not used dry.', u'This far, that claim seems to be true, as the brush has not done any damage to the finishes on my car.The handle is well designed, providing a nice solid grip, even when your hands are wet, while also allowing for applying leverage.', u'The brush is a little on the thin side, so you\\'re generally not able to attack a large area, but the bristles, which are about 0.9\" long, do provide a little extended reach.The soft bristles however, are kind of a double-edged sword.', u\"The brush doesn't tend to scratch surfaces, but the bristles do seem to get deformed rather easily.\", u'When tackling a tough job, like wheel rims, you can apply a lot of muscle, and the brush still does only an average job of cleaning.', u\"Because the bristles tend to get bent out of shape rather easily, you can expect to replace them rather frequently, so it's good that these brushes come in a pack of two, and are not that expensive.These bright red brushes by Mothers, do a fairly good job, and can be used for detailing, but they don't stand up to heavy use very well, so you may need to be prepared to replace them on a regular basis.\", u'I have an 11 year old yamaha in my riding stable and after having some paint repair work done on the back end of it, I found I had an opportunity to clean areas that would otherwise be inaccessible when the bike is assembled.', u\"I purchased the Mothers Detail Brush Set to clean out gunk, old dried oil, bugs, debris and eleven years' worth of dirt from the underside and within cracks of the engine, frame and back end.And these brushes worked perfectly.\", u'I used soapy hot water in a bucket and basically brushed these parts as you would your teeth, occasionally rinsing out the brush in the water.', u'The temperature of the water made the bristles super-soft and despite vigorous brushing I did not damage the paint on the frame or any chrome areas on the engine.', u\"With that said, these ARE brushes and I wouldn't use them on open areas of paint such as the bodywork/bike tins for fear of scratching the clear coat.\", u\"If you have such dirt and gunk on your vehicle on very visible areas whether chrome or paint you probably should be looking at an alternative more delicate cleaning system.The handle was comfortable and firm and didn't bend or break despite applying quite a lot of pressure to it at times and by the end of the cleaning - probably two to three hours - I was still using brush number one and it still has a good bit of life left in it.\", u'I was honestly expecting to go through both brushes on this project and then I was intending on throwing them away.', u\"So I felt I have received excellent value in terms of longevity by still having one quite usable brush and one brand new too.Do take into account that these aren't replacements for microfiber cloths to save time nor are they stiff wire bristles.\", u\"They're over-sized toothbrushes and when used for the appropriate purpose are perfect.\"]\n"

White  distilled vinagar will do the same thing and much much cheaper.\", u'This is however very good and in the need that I have the smaller parts that need the rust off this is going to be my go to item... Just wish the gallon containers of it were around $10 as I think that would be a good buy on it.', u\"10 bucks for 32oz is not a good buy in my opinion...Stuff works though.-Nigel I've tried this on a couple of items and will update my review accordingly.1.\", u'10 Year Old Camshafts (found in the Back of my garage) - rusted and oilyResults: Submerged for 24 hours and most of the rust and all of oil was gone.', u'I took a Scotch Brite pad to the remaining rust and it came right off.2.', u'Battery Corrosion in Flashlight (three AAA batteries were in a flashlight in my car for two years)Results: I soaked the corroded battery holder (the plastic piece that held the three AAA batteries inside the battery case) for two days and most of the corrosion was gone.', u'This was after I tried using baking soda.', u'A quick hit with a tooth brush sealed the deal.', u'The metal contacts are not perfect, but clean enough that I can use the mini-flashlight after it went unused for at least years!', u'The corrosion inside the aluminum flashlight was fixed with baking soda, but if it was any worse I would have soaked the corroded portion in the solution.Overall, this is a good non-toxic product.', u\"The are faster alternatives, but it's safe, reusable and can last for years if you keep it sealed.Next on the testing block will be an old rusted pressure plate from my Nissan Silvia clutch and a bunch of rusted bolts.To be continued....4/14 Update:I filled two Quart containers with oily, rusted bolts that I found around the garage and added Evapo-Rust.\", u'After one day, the bolts looked a little better, but nothing amazing.', u'Day two looked better.', u'On day three, you could see a layer of crud building up at the bottom of the containers.', u'I decided this was long enough, so I dumped them in the sink and grabbed a clean rag.The remains of the rust wiped right off most bolts.', u\"The rust that was REALLY invasive, didn't come completely off, but I have no doubt another few days would have done it.While you can recycle Evapo-Rust, it was so dirty from the oil and rust remains, I decided to get rid of the used portion.\", u\"Overall, 98% of the bolts look like new (in addition to a few rusted nut driver bits that I threw in for good measure) so I can't complain.\", u\"If you are in a rush, you may want to try something else, but I like what I've seen so far.In terms of the chemicals, there was little to no skin irritation on my hands, so that's a big plus!\"]\n",

      "[u'Neat little gadget.', u'Working as it should from out of the box.', u'It is a little large if you like checking tire depth from the top of the tire with a low profile vehicle.', u'Now I have to work at ground level!!', u'If you need precise tire tread depth measurements, this is the gadget for you.', u'I like the zero calibration and the fact that you can change between metric, English and fractions.The precision is so good that you will think that the device is inconsistent if you take several measurements of the same tire unless you make those measurements in the exact same spot every time.', u'Tires are not perfectly round and the tread depth varies around the tire because of braking at different tire positions over time.', u'solid tire depth gauge.', u'few notes:- it measures backwards on the digital though so you have to subtract it from 1 to get the real tread depth.', u\"also doesn't stick with consistent lower fraction number so you have to do some simple math in your head.- the extending bar on the right side is a manual way  to see the tire depth.\", u\"a great backup in case battery dies- it is a bit long so need some clearance to get to the tire tread or just measure down lower on the tire closer to ground- solid metal feel, sturdy.- standard button batteries.- comes with a protective plastic case.---------------------overall pricier than the greasy pen version but the digital is really nice to have and the quality and construction make me think i won't be needing another for many years.\", u'i highly recommend.', u'got it quick, works great love it ,easy to read nice and small easy to carry and easy to store.', u'I use this on my race cars.', u\"It's fast and very simple to use.\", u\"Plus, I don't need my reading glasses to read the scale.\", u'The digital readout is great.', u'I measure tires wear all during practice sessions and after each race.', u'That means the tool gets a lot of use.', u\"The plastic carrying case means I don't have to worry about the tool getting damaged in my pit cart.\", u'I just have to remember to always put it back in the case.', u\"I'm not sure if the average person actually needs this tool but it is great to own.\", u'Although it is usually easy to spot a \"bald\" tire (i.e.', u'one with virtually no tread), you cannot \"eyeball\" tire tread depth any more than you can \"eyeball\" the air pressure in your tires.', u'Instead you need the right tool.', u'Although this is one of the more expensive tire tread depth gages on the market, the quality of construction and ease of use justify the price, and definitely merit the five star ratings this product has received.', u'Here is why I like it:1.', u'This tool has a nice heft, is made out of nicely finished metal rather than cheap plastic, and comes with a hard shell foam padded case, which can easily fit into a glove compartment (the dimensions of the closed case in inches are 6 3/8 by 2 7/8 by 1 1/4).', u'The quality construction is evident.', u'This is a very well made tool, and looks better in person than in the picture.2.', u'This is simple to use.', u'Just loosen the lock screw, push the slide so the narrow point on the left is flush with the metal face, turn the unit on, press the zero button (or alternatively just adjust the slide until it reads zero on the digital display), choose whether you want mm, inches in decimals (tenths of an inch) or inches in fractions (64ths of an inch), put the metal face flush on the tire, push the slide from the \"ruler\" side until the narrow point reaches the bottom of the tread, and see the digital readout.', u'The whole process takes just seconds.I like that you can simultaneously see the reading mechanically on the \"ruler\" part of the slide, which is marked in mm and 32nds of an inch.', u'The new tires that I buy for my cars typically start at 10/32 of an inch (though this can vary depending on the kind of tire, so you need to check what the tread starts out as on whatever tires you are using).', u'Therefore a reading of 5/32 for me means 50% of my tread is gone, at which point I usually replace the tire.3.', u'Opening the battery compartment and installing the battery are simple.', u'This product comes with the necessary battery (and in fact mine also came with a spare).4.', u'The digital display is easy to read, and the digital reading remains on the screen until you either turn the unit off or \"zero it out\" to take another reading.', u'Although I wear glasses, I can easily see the display even without them on.', u'The digital display eliminates any guesswork as to the reading, though as noted above, you can also simultaneously look at a mechanical reading just to confirm the digital readout.5.', u'I have my oil changed at a place that indicates the tread depth on each tire, but I bought this unit so that I could check myself between oil changes, and also verify the readings I am given.', u'This tool easily and accurately lets me do that.Bottom line: If you like using quality tools that are easy to use and work effectively, then I recommend this product for checking your tire tread depth.', u'This tool is handy for me to periodically check the wear on my tires, and is also useful for those who like to buy used tires, or are considering buying a used car and want to check the tire tread depth.']\n"

u'Like many reviewers here, I bought the Camco regulators to lower the water pressure for a separate water hammer arrester, since the arrester specified a 60PSI maximum and my household water pressure is 80PSI.', u\"It's been a couple of weeks and many loads of laundry, and so far they are working well.\", u\"I do note some other users complaining about sticking and will be on the watch for that, but I don't expect backpressure issues in my installation.\", u'Do note that these require the water flow in one direction for proper operation.', u'Works better than the plastic type to keep your RV water pressure where it should be.', u'I like that it is brass and not the plastic type.', u'I do have the plastic type for a back up but prefer this one!', u'A pressure regulator represents a prudent precaution against RV internal water line damage from high or otherwise unknown water pressure.', u'Low water pressure seems to be a more prevalent condition at many camp grounds, however, we have found some with substantially higher pressure that the 50 psi found in most homes.', u\"This is a MUST HAVE for any RV's.\", u\"Nothing like a $7 insurance policy to protect my RV's water lines.\", u'Found this all brass one for the same price as what I could find plastic ones for locally.', u'Camco makes several great products....I have purchased many and not had a problem with any of them.', u'Serves its purpose.']\n"

it.\", u'My search for a better filter removal tool brought me here.I like to tighten my oil filters as tight as I can by hand, so I always use a removal tool to loosen it.', u'This tool has never failed to easily loosen the oil filter in all our vehicles.The pros:+ Low cost, which includes free shipping.+ This tool fits 2-1/2\" to 3-1/8\" filters.The cons:- None that I can think of.', u':) So far I have used this on my lawnmower filter ( John Deere D110 ) and Acura Integra.', u'Its awesome because it GRIPS!', u'No slippage on the filter, no falling off, ad no need for multiple oil filter sockets.', u'This is a must have item if you change oil yourself.', u'I got this for my waverunner oil filter.', u'I was unable to remove the filter with any other wrench and this one  really grips the small filter.', u'Great tool to have for stubborn filters.', u'Great starting tool for a new General Service Tech.', u\"Really good for Subaru's If you've ever had to change the oil in your Subaru, you know just how difficult the filter can be to remove with the exhaust manifold in the way.\", u'With this handy tool you just attach it to a 3/8&#34; extension and ratchet and you can say goodbye to burnt knuckles for good.The technicians here at the Subaru dealership I work at turned me on to these when I saw how easy they remove filters all day.', u\"I'm certain that this would work on a variety of other filter sizes as it expands to fit.\", u'Well worth the cash if you ask me.', u'work great for my John Deere X500 I have needed this tool for years.The old style metal tape filter wrench never did do the job right.Now I have a very dependable tool that will remove the filter quickly.I highly recommend getting one of these for your tool box.', u\"Very high quality oil filter wrench and it's made in USA!\", u'Needs 3/8\" wrench and gives good leverage to get the oil filter out.', u'Got this after I struggled with oil filter plier bought from a local B&M store.', u'Hoping to use this for a long time!', u'Lisle, great products an I love the quality of them and have had them for many years!', u'You get what you pay for I bought this wrench to remove the oil filters on my arctic cat quads.', u'I can never get them off and have resorted to punching holes in them with a screwdriver and then turning the screwdriver to remove the filter.', u'This wrench worked like a charm and I no longer have to tear  up the oil filter to remove it.', u'This tool surprised me.', u\"It is made extremely well, I can't over-state this.\", u'This will fit 99.9% of all oil filters, and there is no struggling with other types of tools/wrenches.', u'It has a spring mechanism where you simply put a ratchet on this and it self fits to any size filter.. and you twist.', u\"Great grip,.. best wrench I've ever used and being universal mean you never need to swap out for another for any other vehicles/tractors, etc.\", u'This replaces a dozen other tools.', u\"i have all the others and they don't come close, makes the job fast and reliable.\", u\"though one time it started crushing the filter I was worried once it crushes there's no way to use this tool.\", u'I found  it was on the edge of the filter moved it up more and it came right off.wish I had this decades ago The oil filter on my Kubota tractor was cranked on tight by the dealership, and no oil filter wrench seemed to be able to get it off.This one did, and I was able to change my own oil.This filter also fits other sizes, too, so I can use it on my other vehicles.', u'This is the one to buy!Pros:- Cheap- Just the right size to remove the blue oil filter on my 2011 Subaru WRX.', u'Attaches to a standard 3/4\" ratchet.', u\"Hasn't seen a filter on my car that it couldn't remove.- If you're not sure about your filter size, it comes with a template on the back so you can measure up your car's filter against it to see if it works for you before you open it.\", u'I like that it has a good range of filters it can accommodate.Cons:- For filters that have been overtightened (i.e.', u'at the dealership), it permanently dents the filter, but who cares?', u\"It doesn't dent the filters I installed to the proper tightening specification.- Packaging is kind of weaksauce, but I could care less.- It's not very pretty, and the spring and mechanism are all exposed, but again, this tool is about functionality and you only use it once every couple months.\", u'Bought this after I could not remove a tight filter from my 2008 Camry with a cap-type remover.', u'This slips on the filter easily in confined spaces and grips the can well, thanks to the two spring-retained semicircles on this tool.', u'Looks like this is very well made and should outlast me.', u'Well worth the price to end the frustration of a frozen filter!', u\"This is the best solution I've used for an all-in-one oil filter wrench (although you actually need 2 to cover the majority of sizes).\", u\"It works only to loosen, not to tighten - and of course you'd never want to tighten an oil filter with a tool anyway.\", u'Very nice.Note that this is listed on Amazon at least twice, and one is priced almost three times as much as the other.', u'No oil filter within its size that this tool can not open.', u'Buy it once and no need to buy anything again.', u'This item is primarily used for REMOVAL, not installation of an oil filter that has been tightened too much to remove by hand.', u'The half-circles of metal grip the canister of the oil filter and they dig into that sheet metal to prevent slipping when you apply pressure to your wrench handle and start to turn.', u'The tool may need to dig in enough to dent the oil filter canister depending on the degree of excessive tightening by a previous installer.', u'Each half circle on the tool is brought to initial grip and held there by a set of springs on a sliding mount to accommodate a variety of filter canister sizes.', u'I used it to remove the original factory oil filter for the first oil change on a new vehicle.', u\"I probably won't have to use it ever again.\", u\"In 40 years of DIY oil changes across a couple dozen different cars, I've never had a leak by simply hand-tightening the canister to the mount.\", u'Great, versatile oil filter.', u'I have a Passat and couldnt find a wrench to fit it easily.', u'Bought this and it works great.', u\"For the longest time I've avoided changing the oil on my wife's Camry myself simply because it's so cramped under the car and I could hardly even get my hand in to reach the oil filter, let alone get a traditional filter wrench up there.\", u'Well, I finally got sick of paying $85 for Jiffy Lube to change the oil and decided to give this tool a try.', u'Worked like a charm.', u'I popped my 3/8\" drive socket extension onto the back, slide it over the filter, tightened down, and it popped right off without crushing.', u\"Couldn't have been any easier.\", u\"This time around I replaced the filter with a K&N; filter that has the 1-inch nut on top since that's what I'd already bought, but I may start using this tool and traditional K&N; filters in the future just because it was so easy and it'd save me about $3 a filter.If you've never spent more than 5 seconds trying to loosen an oil filter, do yourself a favor and get this.\", u\"It'll literally be that quick.\", u'This seems like a well-made tool.', u'Good design, quality materials, solid construction.', u'Had a tough time removing my factory-installed filter, but this tool made the job a snap.', u'And a good price, too.', u'Highly recommended.', u'I purchased this back in 1992 for my Oldsmobile and have used it on every car since: Accord, Civic, Integra, GTI, 240SX, 200SX, Maxima, Sentra and I could go on... You name it and it works.', u'If you have a super wide filter or really tight space where the ratchet attaches, it may not be ideal.', u\"In my opinion, it's worked on 95% of the vehicles I've owned and this tool is awesome!\", u'If you are going to have oil change at home than you must have this good US made oil filter tool.']\n"

you're willing to pay for extra options.\", u'The only issue I have is they try to get you to sign up for some monthly fee to research the codes you pull.', u\"I don't feel its needed, I haven't signed up for it, and I think it should be a free service (for the cost of the device).\", u'The scanner gives more than enough info, and if you need more detail, Google does a great job of that...

      "[u'SPLAT - the \"Cleaning Putty that removes debris from nooks and crannies\" -- does what it claims to do -- it DOES pick up (very nicely) that dust and dirt and debris that collects in those hard-to-reach corners, nooks and crannies of the car body.Using it takes a bit of adjustment -- it is super \"viscous\".', u'You need to hold it firmly in your hand, and then press down just as firmly to make total contact.', u\"Lift it up - there's the dirt.\", u'Don\\'t leave it on too long, or you will have to tug at it to get it off, and there might be some \"droplets\" left on the finish, MOST of which can be picked up by pressing SPLAT back onto the droplets.', u'There was a \"Shadow\" left on my car\\'s surface for a brief instant after lift-off, but upon inspection, it was not any kind of oil and it actually dissipated/evaporated in a few seconds.This would, IMHO, be great to use as a \"before\" wax prep, after you have washed the car and dried it off -- so all the dirt is actually GONE before you wax.', u'I would think it would also be great to use at a rod run or local car show, to get off any bits of dust that may have migrated to that otherwise-spotless finish.Word of caution -- try not to drop it on the ground.', u'Sadly, there was a newly mulched lawn right next to my car and while I was using this product, I dropped it... on the mulch.', u'True to form, after I picked out what mulch pieces I could, SPLAT just prety much surrounded the rest of the mulch with its gooey body (after being placed back in its jar for a while) and kept on performing its job flawlessly.June 2012: UPDATE.', u'SPLAT is Dead.', u'Long Live SPLAT... Would I buy this again?', u'well...', u'I would consider it.', u'It has now turned into a container of SPLAT soup.', u'Yes, I left it in the car over the winter but we had a mild winter....', u'It is orange and kind of \"icky\"- seems like something a 5 year old would think is cool.', u\"If you stepped on it in the dark, you'd scream.But the purpose of the stuff is to get dust and dirt out of small places.\", u'It seems to do that well.', u'I tried it on a couple spots on my car that always seem to gather dirt but resist cleaning- such as radio buttons, the lips around buttons and controls, crevices in the trim panels, etc.', u'In every case it seemed to get most of the dust out, although it seemed to have trouble with larger pieces of dirt.', u'It does not work very well on anything that is \"stuck\", since it doesn\\'t seem to have a whole lot of sticky attraction.It never seemed to leave any residue on any of the surfaces in the car-although I never tried it on glass or clear plastic where a residue might be more visible.I also tried it on my cell phone-which seems to have all sorts of places to collect dust.', u'It did a reasonable job on the dust, but I did notice small pieces of the goo breaking off, especially around the buttons.', u\"These came off pretty easy, but you would hope this wouldn't happen.\", u'Based on that, I was afraid to try it on my laptop keyboard-something I was hoping it would be suited for.Is it the cure-all solution to all your tight-space cleaning needs?', u\"No, I don't think so.\", u'But in 5 minutes it did make a noticeable improvement on my \"just cleaned\" dashboard.', u'It works great on dust, not quite as good on larger particles.', u'It did \"refresh\" my cell phone and got rid of some dust that has been there for quite a while.It does come in a jar with a tight seal, so it should last between uses...unless your 5-year-old finds it.', u\"I do hope it is as non-toxic as advertised, because it certainly will be attractive to kids.While I don't see a residue, I would certainly not trust it on photo lenses or sensors.\", u'Splat is an orange colored glop.', u'It feels like something a kid would like on Halloween.', u\"It's kind of fun actually.\", u'More importantly, this product solves a problem that has bugged us all at one time or another: it gets those crumbs and bits of stuff out of hard-to-reach cracks and crevices.', u'You know, like the space on the center console of the car where crud accumulates next to the automatic transmission lever.', u'I have tried everything from cotton swabs to pencil points.', u'That stuff just refused to leave.Another problem place is the small spaces on a computer keyboard or a laptop.', u\"You can't use liquid cleaners unless you want to short out the computer.\", u'Another one of those petty daty-to-day problems.Enter Splat (what a great name!).', u'Just take some of the stuff and jam it into those hard-to-reach spots and Viola!', u'the dirt comes up with the goop when you remove it.', u'Even better, the stuff is reusable.', u'Just stuff it back into its jar, tighten the lid and save it for the next time you want to get some crud out of a small place.Bottom line: this stuff is great.', u\"It works as advertised, gets the job done, and doesn't appear to leave any residue.\", u\"It's also non-toxic and reusable.\", u'This stuff is truly a bargain.', u\"It works, it's fun, and you can use it to scare your friends.\", u'Cool!', u'This Splat stuff is really interesting.', u'When I first got the jar, it was filled to the top with gooey shivery bright orange goo that is the same type of thing we used to get at the toy store and throw against the wall and watch it roll down.This glob of goo, however, is supposed to be used to clean crevices in your car- speakers, dials, switches, vents, etc, that you can not easily clean otherwise.', u'I did not use this goo right away, and almost a month later, I was surprised to see that the volume of the Splat goo went down by half.', u'It had shrunk- and no one had taken any out either.It is a bit weird to get used to using at first too, but it quickly becomes easy to manipulate into little places you want to clean.When using it, it really does work.', u'Little switches and indented areas that gather a lot of dirt and dust were cleaned well with no residue.', u\"The only problems I had were two:---Don't drop it on the floor or it will grab every single stone, piece of dirt, or garbage it touches.---Don't let it touch the windows or it will leave a smudge that you can only see at night when lights are coming at you and it can be very distracting.\", u'It does wash off relatively easily- but it takes a bit of work to get it back to the way it was.All in all, however, I like Splat.', u\"As long as I don't drop it or let it touch any windows in the car, it does a good job.\", u'It is only useable for 50 uses and that is not a whole lot- but it is biodegradable.', u'I have not used it up yet so I can not comment on the biodegradability of Splat.', u\"Ok, so it looks strange, feels strange, and makes you think of 50's movies...but it works.\", u\"I've cleaned out the vents of three cars and all their other nooks.\", u'Used in the house for heating vents, air intakesanything small and difficult to get to.', u\"It's simple, easy to use, shows no sign of reduced effectiveness after some hard use.Leaves no residue I could detect it's a simple smart fix for a niche problem almost everyone has.\", u'Good stuff.', u\"I wasn't 100% sure what to expect when I got this, but I tried it out as soon as it arrived, and WOW!My car was professionally detailed about three weeks ago, and I was blown away by how much crud Splat picked up.\", u'Splat works so well in vents and crevices like around the shifter, gaps in the dash molding, and other places that you\\'ll fall in love instantly if you like keeping your interior looking as new as you can.Cleaning my vents used to take 15 minutes or more with a detailing brush to get them dust free, and Splat knocked the job out in a couple minutes, with results better than I\\'ve ever got on my own.Now, looking at the pictures, you might be thinking \"Oh, it\\'s slime.', u\"My kid's got that.\", u'\", but the consistency is much different.', u'Splat stays a cohesive blob, and is much more tacky than toy slime.', u\"It isn't unbreakable by any means, but for grabbing dust and debris, you're not going to lose pieces of it when you take it off.Based on my experience with it, I'd expect it to cost twice as much as it does, and to be honest, I'd still consider it to be a fair value.\", u\"For how well it works, how much time it saves, and what the cost is here, it's a tremendous value.\", u'You really owe it to yourself to give Splat a shot.', u'If you were a kid in the 1970s, you will remember the useless toy called \"Slime\" - a bright green concoction that while cool-to-the-touch, felt like holding the world\\'s largest ball of snot.', u'It was packaged in a plastic trash can and lid that kept the product moist and fresh.', u'While the color has changed, the smell has not.', u\"I had an immediate flashback to the 1970s when opening the container, and a tactile flashback when handling the bright orange goo.Like the green slime of the 70s, it doesn't keep its looks for long.\", u'Back when your slime went bad, you threw it out and hoped mom would buy you more.', u\"The genius of Splat is that you take that gunk-acquiring goo to pick up stuff you can't.It will pick up gunk on its own, but it shouldn't be the only thing you use to clean your car, or you will do a mediocre job and exhaust all uses of the Splat.\", u'The description of \"50 uses\" is a bit vague, but it does underscore that its useful lifespan is not \\'forever.', u\"'I live out in the country and my car gets dusty - fast.\", u\"I've got two dogs that shed and I've been known to eat in my car on more than one occasion.\", u'Yesterday, I did a long-overdue detailing on the inside of my car.', u'I took out the floor mats, vacuumed the entire car and cleaned the dash with an all-purpose cleaner and paper towels.', u\"Once everything was all spic-n-span, the nooks and crannies still gave my car the 'yuck' look with the stray dog hairs, road grit and crumbs sticking in places that were visible, but inaccessible to mere mortals.\", u'I grabbed the ball of splat and pushed it into the crannies and rolled it out and voila!', u'All the debris was gone!', u'In short order, the bright orange splat was mostly grey after I ran the ball of goo through the louvres of the air conditioner vents, all the buttons around the radio and the slot-loading area of the CD player.', u'Now I understand how dealerships get a used car looking showroom fresh... because my 4 year old car looks brand new inside... and smells fresh, too.', u'All the gunk in those nooks & crannies holds bacteria and hence, odor.', u'Getting rid of all that junk makes my car look as good as it did when I drove it off the lot years ago.I discovered that pushing and pulling and/or rolling is the best way to go.', u\"You don't want to use a 'scrubbing' motion or grind the Splat, or pieces will break off instead of grabbing the gunk - the gunk will grab the splat.\", u'After I got the knack of it - cleaning when by in short order.', u'If you like a well detailed car and are eager to get to the crumbs and dust particles in your floor shift area, around your hand brake, around your window controls, etc., this is the stuff for you.', u'I highly recommend Splat.', u'When I first opened the jar of SPLAT, it looked sort of like orange Jell-O.', u'I worried that it would be sticky to deal with, but I simply upended the jar and the putty slid out easily onto my hand.', u'It is not at all sticky, it is a wet gel that holds together much better than I expected.', u'I rolled it around on various surfaces in my car, and it did a great job of picking up dust and lint without leaving any kind of residue.', u'The only issue I had was that there was a narrow crack between two dash panels where there was a piece of some white lint - the SPLAT did not manage to work its way enough into the crack to pick up the lint, but a swipe with a brush took care of that.', u'No matter how I manipulated the SPLAT, it stayed as one \"blob\" and did not separate.']\n"

recommended I purchase this if I don't ride everyday.\", u\"While I suppose the loose nuts/cables on my battery cause my issue, I definitely love the peace of mind this little guy gives me.I plug it in when I know I won't be riding the bike for a few days and it's off my mind.\", u\"I don't have to think about it and that's what is so cool.Sometimes, I question the initial red light when I plug it in (especially after having just ridden my bike for many, many miles).\", u\"But, when I get ready to hop on the bike and see that green light shining at me, I know my ride will be trouble-free (as far as the battery goes).Personally, I used the 'permanent' hook-ups provided that basically bolts to your battery connections.\", u'The extension that stays on your bike tucks away nicely and plugs back in quickly.', u\"I don't think I'd want to fart around with the alligator clip option, simply because it's too many extra steps.\", u'Keeps my battery charged and easy to hook up.', u\"Just connect either the alligator clips or the ring terminals and plug the unit into the wall and you're done!\", u'This unit is very simple a single LED tells you the status of the charge/battery.', u\"For the price can't go wrong and it's nice to know that when you go to start up whatever it is, you can count on it.\", u'I use this on my r1 during the cold days in winter or when ever i put the bike in to storage.', u'Still working till now and this includes a spare wire to place a dis-connectable connector from your battery to the battery tender (which can be routed from your battery to your backseat compartment) Highly recommended.', u'This is your basic maintenance battery charger and is well worth the money.', u'I would buy this one again, with out hesitation.', u'This works great with my John Deere rider.', u\"With the Deere sitting for a week between mowing, or just over the winter, it didn't always want to immediately start.\", u'So about 15 minutes before I plan to mow I put this tender on and it charges up the battery so that it immediately starts.', u\"Nice!I also use this for a Jeep and a trailer that don't get driven a lot.\", u'This is the best thing for keeping your battery up when being stored.Once your batery is up to a full charge, it practicaly uses no power.', u'It only kicks on when the voltage falls below a usable charge.', u'It has a plug in adapter that you can fasten on to the battery permanately and just plug it into the charger when needed.', u'I bought a couple of these.', u\"One to maintain my camper batteries while it is in storage for the winter and one to maintain the batteries on a vehicle I don't drive much.\", u'So far they have done their job.', u\"Camper is ready to go when I need it and the vehicle I don't drive starts right up when I want to use it.\", u'Very easy to install.', u'It looks and acts just like the one I bought from Haley for $50.00 more.', u\"Don't ever let you self be let down, have this on all of my motorcycles to insure a start every time!\", u'Great product.', u'Do his job... charging batteries for my motorcycle... working perfectly....Read the battery life and charge when it needs...', u\"I have several bikes and each one's battery gets the tender in the winter season.\", u\"I usually bring the batteries in the house over winter and that has been working great, but I don't think you really have to unless your garage is super cold in winter.\", u\"If you own a motorcycle and don't ride much through the winter months this is a must have item.\", u\"It will keep your battery in tip top condition so you'll be ready to ride when the weather gets good.\", u'Just plug in and forget it I use this on my race car and it works very well.', u\"I'm considering picking up another for my motorcycle.\", u'I have used many of these and have always found them useful for keeping your motorbike, 4 wheeler, mower or seldom driven collector car ready to turn over, The technology will not damage your battery or get too hot.', u'The cheapest place in town to get this is AutoZone and they want $39.99 for it.', u'At $25, free shipping and no tax, this is a smoking hot deal.', u\"Just a note, I'm putting this on mowers and ATVs.\", u'The cost of a replacement battery is about $40 for a mower and as much as $100 for the ATVs.', u\"So this is a no brainer here.It plugs directly into the wall and comes with about a 6' cord, a permanent battery connection and a second connection with big alligator clips.\", u'So you can put the permanent part on one piece of equipment and use the alligator clips on something else if need be.', u\"if you store motorcycles,riding mowers,atv's or any type of automobile for more than a month at a time this thing is worth it.\", u'This is a great little charger, especially for the price.', u'Simple hookup with the ring terminals on my motorcycle and the connector stays zip-tied to the subframe just below the seat.', u'Once connected the LED on the charger gives me status information at a glance so I can always tell when the battery is charging or sitting there maintaining a full charge.', u\"Battery Tender's are wonderful for keeping batteries fully charged when not in use for mowers, cars, ATV's, RV's, trucks and motorcycles or whatever is in storage.\", u'My Mom has a 2007 accord that fairly well has a motorcycle battery 51R.', u\"I got her one of these because she doesn't drive that car much.My wife makes short trips to work and I bought another for myself to top off her battery if the car sets all weekend which it does sometimes.\", u\"It doesn't really need it as much since it has a real car battery but it's helpful.\", u'I have a full sized charger and this one is much easier because you can attach the bolt on  accessory to the battery and just pop the hood and plug it in.', u'You still get the alligator clip accessory to use on others cars while the bolt on accessory is on the first car.', u\"It's a handy tool and I have had no problems with it.Some people say the HF ones are cheaper as about as good.\", u\"I don't know, I never had one,  I know this one works.\", u'If you ride every day or once a month you need this product.', u'It will save you from having to call a tow truck, cold cranking problems in the morning and buying a battery every time you ride after a long winter.', u'Simply works as described.', u'Kept my battery tended all winter.', u'LONG cords are nice.', u'Seems rugged.', u\"It's all I need!\", u\"I don't drive much, and my car can sit in the garage for a couple of weeks between uses.\", u\"I've been having a problem keeping the battery charged, especially in the winter.\", u\"It's always started, but it clearly is struggling to get the engine to turn over.My mechanic offered two suggestions: drive more or get a trickle/float charger.\", u\"Since a charger was only about $20, I figured it was the better route to take rather than waste gas.I looked at a couple of similar models, especially the Black & Decker BM3B model (Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer) since the price included attachments to plug the charger into the car's power outlet.\", u'However, since my car (an Infiniti) does not have a \"hot\" plug, those attachments would not have been of any use.The Battery Tender Jr had a lot of good reviews, so I gave it a shot.', u\"So far, it's been working great.\", u'It took about 24 hours to bring my battery up to the full charge level.', u'The unit is very easy to use, and all the attachments are well-made.', u'The LED status lights clearly indicate the charge status.', u'The only quibble I have is that the charger unit does not have a cord - it plugs directly into the wall (or, in my case, into an extension cord).', u'The next model up in the Battery Tender line (the Plus) has a cord, and also charges faster, but also comes in at twice the price of the Junior.', u'So I went with the Junior.Very pleased with this, and highly recommend it.', u'Seven years on a motorcycle battery.', u'That is how long my friends battery lasted--and it was still good, with this battery tender.Batteries are damaged several ways.', u'This prevents them all.1.', u'Overcharging--this is smart and stops charging when not needed.2.', u'Fast charging--this is a trickle charger--it is anything but fast.3.', u'Deep discharges--Keep this hooked up and plugged in and your battery will not die.', u'It is that simple.Often cars and motorcycles will have some sort of small drain that will discharge your batteries and kill them.', u'A deep discharge is very bad for a battery.', u'This charger prevents that from happening.I put one on my mothers car which as a drain somewhere that killed the battery.', u'It was a new battery, so I attached this and ran the connector out of the grill.', u\"Now it is always fully charged.I have two of these--both work great and I'm back to buy another one, although I'd like a bit large one two maintain my dual batteries in my diesel pickup truck.For a normal sized car, motorcycle or ATV, this is a great product.One final thing.\", u\"I like that it has several ways to connect including alligator clips, but given it's cheap price, buy one for every vehicle and hard wire it straight to your battery.\", u'I purchased this unit to condition and maintain my AGM battery I just purchased for my motorcycle.', u'This unit provides the tender cable needed for installation on the battery and hooks up to it easily.', u'The unit is pretty much idiot proof with no dial or settings.', u'Only has one LED that displays the current mode the tender is in and the state of your battery.', u\"Can't get much better than that.\", u'I put my sports car to bed in the winter, battery would be dead with out this charger.', u'Needed an extension to reach the car good pricedoes its job flawlesslynot a single problem5 stars without question, buy it, you wont regret it Great battery tender.', u'I use this to charge my tractor and jet ski batteries during winter.', u\"I've also got one hooked up to my convertible while it sits in the garage during colder weeks (or on my other car when the convertible comes out of storage).\", u'Works with all types of batteries, including AGM.', u\"Highly recommended -- you won't find better for the price.\", u'Rugged little thing works like a charm.', u'Keeps the battery on the bike topped up all winter long and never misses a beat.', u'The quick leads make plugging/unplugging really easy as well.', u\"Pick one up if you're

problems.', u'i got this tender for charging two motorcycles that i have.', u'i was able to fully charge a brand new battery i purchased (its recommended to charge a new motorcycle battery after adding the acid).', u'i like that this comes with a long enough cord so i can plug it into the outlet without moving my bike or using an extension cable.', u'it also comes with the clamps and adapter you can use if your battery has this for easy charging.', u\"i used this on a shorai battery for my cbr and worked great.there are no settings to change, just attach the connection to the battery and plug it into the wall outlet and you're good to go.great tender for a good price i have been using this for years and have purchased these for friends and family.\", u\"In the winter time, my motorcycle (CBR 600RR) used to die when I didn't disconnect it.\", u'However, with the tender plugged in all winter, I never had trouble in Spring.', u'I no longer have my motorcycle, but now use this for my Troy Bilt Riding Mower (Super Bronco).', u'It works wonderfully and I keep it plugged in all winter, and when grass cutting season comes along, my mower starts right up.', u'You simply connect the clamps to the battery correctly and just \"forget about it\".', u\"It's a smart charger, and won't over charge your battery.I highly recommend this if you own a Riding Mower or Motorcycle.\", u\"Batteries aren't cheap!\", u'I have needed one of these for a while, even in an Arizona winter.', u\"When I can't ride my bike for two weeks, I don't have to worry about it not starting.\", u'It only took about two hours to \"top off\" my battery.', u'Nice little item.', u'A must have for every motorcyle rider!', u\"I have one for all 4 of my motorcycles as well as got them for my Dad and

and include multiple battery connectors so you can install a permanent connection if you choose (I did this on my Harley for easy of use during the winter months).', u\"I use the Junior model on my

easy to plug in and charge the motorcycle batteries.I double checked with volt meter at the end of charging and was at proper voltage Well made.', u'I like the quick disconnect harness that comes with this unit.', u'Brings battery to full charge and switches to maintenance level.', u'I use this on myYuasa YUAM32ABS YT12A-BS Batteryto make sure it stays charged.', u\"It's a must have during the winter storage months.\", u\"It takes a while to get to the float mode because it's the jr, but it does it's job.\", u'I bought this product to keep my motorcycle charged between rides.', u\"I ride the bike pretty often so I probably don't need it but it does come in handy for those occasions when I go a week or more without riding, like when I am doing upgrades or repairs to the bike.\", u'I just plug it in the night before a ride and in the morning the battery is fully charged and ready to roll.', u'Great product for a reasonable price.', u'I really like the jumper cables and keep them in  my saddle bag in case of emergencies!', u'I have too many cars.', u'And, with the cold winter with too much snow in the north east, my special cars spent months idle in the garage.', u'My friend, owner of several Ferraris, sung the praises of Battery Tender and convinced me to try one on my old BMW.', u\"The battery is in the trunk on that car so it's a pain to check.\", u'I hooked up the charger using the cigarette lighter attachment and within 18 hours, the little light went green.', u'I jumped in for a quick drive last Friday (our first warm and sunny day) and my old Bimmer started right up.', u\"I will get 2 more for the Audi and my aging race car.In today's hyperbolic world, it's refreshing that a product simply does exactly what they claim it will do.\", u'And at a price that is quite reasonable.', u'Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected.', u'Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired.', u'This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger.', u\"Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger.\", u'Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery.', u'I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck.', u'You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle.', u'I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.', u'Works great to make sure that my generator is always ready to go in case we loose power in our neighborhood.', u\"One of these can extend the life of a seldom-used car or motorcycle battery by several years, and the charger itself will last for quite a few years, so it's well worth the investment.\", u'These are excellent and come with all the necessary attachments.', u'I use them on my street bikes, my cars and even the yard tractor if they are going to be sitting for any amount of time.', u'They either work, or I am just extremely lucky with batteries because I get 4-6+ years out of my batteries and have had no issues with either the batteries or the chargers.If I leave for more than 2 weeks the battery in my Audi drains down because of the constant vampiric drain from the electronics.', u\"With this, it's a 2 min job to hook up and I never have any issues.\", u\"I own 4 of them and I recommend them to anybody who's not using LiPo batteries.\", u'I keep the battery charged in my Buick Grand National with a Battery Tender Junior.', u'Takes up very little space and does the job well.', u'This is a great item.', u'Works well.', u'Indicator lights let you know the status of the battery.', u'Very pleased with this battery tender.', u'Well made, comes with two kinds of connectors, not very expensive - put it on the bike and it takes care of everything as long as you need it to - no overcharging, no battery damage.', u'Awesome product.', u'Small, simple - exactly what I needed.', u'what more can I say?', u'These work great, I have four.', u'Best price I can get is here on Amazon, $2-6 more in the store.', u\"The lights tell you if it's charged, almost charged, or being charged.Have never had an issue with it over-charging.I keep it plugged in 24/7.\", u'Not to much i can add about a barrety tender i have had a lot of motorcycles over the years and they habe proven.', u'To be outstanding.', u'.highly recommend I use it to charge my scooter and it works great.', u'Very easy to use.', u'I would recommend this product.', u'We already owned two of these for our racing needs.', u'When we needed another charging unit it was a no-brainer to get a third.', u'They just work flawlessly and never over charge a battery.', u'I have been using two of these battery tenders for my Yamaha snowmobiles for 2 years  now.', u'I leave them plugged in all the time.', u'The batteries are always fully charged, and have never had a worry about not having full battery when I need it, regardless of how cold it got.', u'I would purchase again no question about it.10/11/12 Update, just purchased 2 more I love them so much.', u'Have left the previous 2 on the snowmobiles, and now have one on lawn tractor, and the other new one on the CAN-AM Spyder.', u\"I use these on all my vehicles, from my 1930 Model A (6 volt version) to my quad and my '07 Silverado.\", u'They are very easy to install and should be used on any vehicle that sits for over a month at a time.', u'I have nothing bad to say about them.', u'Every one I have came with two sets of leads, and makes it very nice for multiple vehicles.', u'This is a great product to use on any cars, lawn equipment, etc...that you store in the winter.', u'Keeps my Miata battery charged and ready to start in the Spring.', u'I own three of these and they have all worked flawlessly for several years.', u'This is a no-brainer product - it just works - no instructions or complexity needed!', u\"I have a quick connect dongle attached to the terminals on my battery, so in less than 2 minutes I had this product out of it's box and plugged into my motorcycle.\", u'A red light came on to let me know it was charging - and a green light alerted me when it was finished.', u'A++ it works as needed, when needed, and I have no complaints.', u'Nice long cord, BIG led light, and easy instructions.', u'great price, quick delivery, use several of these battery tenders on cars, trucks, motorcycles, and any battery that might tend to sit-idle for extended periods - highly recommended i have a garage car that doesnt see much usage.', u'this device keeps it charged and ready.', u'been using it for quite sometime now and no issues whatsoever with it.', u'I bought this to maintain my motorcycle battery through the winter.', u'Have ever experienced the time, and I am sure your have, when the weather nerd was wrong?', u\"It was supposed to be nice for your ride to and from work, the cold front with near freezing rain came rolling in 12 hours early, you didn't quite have the battery fully charged before you left because it would charge enough while you rode, then you got stopped by every red light on the way to work for a 10 hour shift, your bike sits 6 hours in 30 degree weather, and you come out only to hear the starter relay just click?\", u'Then your fingers are frozen and numb, and you are trying to get the tools out so you can open the cover where the battery is so you can jump it off with a car, when the rubber strap (the one that has many names) that holds the tool bag in finally pops loose and slaps you in the knuckles?', u'Then this is the one thing a biker (or anyone with a car, truck, snowmobile that they use only occasionally) needs to keep the battery in top condition to avoid part of the scenario.', u'It is easy to hook up, keeps the battery topped off, saves your battery, saves your knuckles, allows the people in the parking lot NOT to hear your extensive vocabulary, and is easy to use.Disclaimer:I cannot make claims to it being able to control or predict the weather, but then again neither can those college educated nerds... though some of those weather ladies can get away with anything in my book :-)I hope this review helps.', u'I like the Junior and just let it sit and charge.', u'The green LED light stays on and lets you know the battery is 100%.', u'No issues.', u'I like that it comes with two sets of cables.', u'I purchased to of these because I store two vehicles during the winter.', u'Not much to say, I just plug them in and forget them.', u'Keep my batteries fully charged.', u'The worst possible thing to do to a lead acid battery is to let it fully discharge.', u'I keep Battery Tenders on all my equipment batteries and have never had a battery fail in less than 8 years.', u'I did have one Battery Tender Jr go bad but the company replaced it for the $7 shipping fee.', u'This item will help keep your battery on full charge,and ready to go all the time, when used properly.', u'Use in conjunction with the extender cord,(will let you park farther from the wall plug).', u'I need to keep my Vette breathing so I purchased this!', u'Recommended by many Vette owners.', u'This will work on any platform that requires a charge.', u'Thanks again!', u\"Have used these chargers for years and never had a problem with them or the vehicles i've used them on.\", u'This includes My Harley softtail (have the charger sold by Harley but its the same mfg) One currently on my Snapper riding mower during the winter months and 1 on my 20hp Mercury motor on a crabbing boat.', u'Highly recommend this brand.', u'I have a large battery charger but this little thing actually does a better job.', u\"If the battery is quite low it takes many hours to recharge it but once charged it won't overcharge.\", u'I use it on our boat and two personal watercraft.', u\"I'd like to have one for each of those and may buy a  couple more to do just that.\", u'I leave the battery tender on the boat battery all winter long.', u'For 30 years, I have been fighting with dead batteries on seasonal vehicles like ATVs, mowers, tractors and emergency generators.', u'In spite of my best efforts, I always managed to miss at least one battery when making my charging rounds every month or so.Batteries can be stubborn.', u'They only turn up dead when you need them the most.A life span of 12 months for a 12V lawn and garden battery was acceptable.', u'After all, the warranty is only 3 months.Some motorcycle and ATV batteries cost as much as a car battery and 12 months was about the best I could hope for.About 4 years ago, I began using the Battery Tenders on all of my seasonal and special use batteries.', u'My 12V lawn and garden and ATV batteries are lasting between 3 and 4 years now.The big 12V, 72-month generator battery might last forever.', u\"It went out of warranty in 2010.Lawn & garden batteries cost about the same as the Battery Tender Junior which means that I'm saving about $48.00 every 3 years on each piece of equipment that uses such a battery.If I'd been using Battery Tenders on my ATVs for the past 30 years, I could have retired much earlier.\", u\"I've been using the battery tender for the past month 24/7.\", u'I have it hooked up to a motorcycle battery while I am restoring a bike.', u'It has several safety precautions in place to make sure accidents do not happen.', u'There are two cord hook ups (one being alligator clamps, the other being a circular terminal) that both use a water resistant two pole connector.', u'Both cords also have inline fuses that come with a 7.5amp fuse in place.', u'The charger brings the battery to 100% charge then essentially turns itself off and watches the battery until it drops to 80%.', u'Once the battery is at 80% the charger engages and brings the battery back to 100%.', u'This is why it is called a battery tender and it essential for keeping the battery in good health.Mine is yet to fail me and has not sparked or caused any explosions yet.', u'5 stars for the good build quality as well as having two different hook-up styles.', u'I use this to keep the battery on my camper charged up for emergencies.', u'Does a good job, shipped on time and was packaged very well.', u'Had a different charger on my ATV and it kept draining and turning my batteries to garbage.', u'I replaced with this Batteries Tender and it is working great.', u\"Good buy I've used this Tender before, and it was always dependable.\", u'I ordered two more of them for my extra vehicles.', u'Battery Tenders are a requirement if you want a recreational vehicle/ collector car / motorcycle battery to last through winter storage.', u'I have used these for several years and can attest to their value.I would recommend this product for maintaining battery health.', u'Have not needed to actually use it yet, but was mainly to have around when the time would come for it.', u'These trickle chargers are just what the doctor ordered to keep your weekend cruisers charged and ready to roll.', u'My luck being the way it is the battery clamps on my CTS are of a style that made adapting the included ring terminals very challenging.', u'So the fix for my application was to order a lighter adapter and extension harness which is also conveniently available from Amazon.', u'Even with the need for extra accessories I am happy with the product...', u'This is the second junior I have owned.', u'My first was used on my motorcycles, worked great, and was eventually included in the sale of a motorcycle.', u'I have never used the clip adapters but the ring terminal adapter is great.', u'You attach it to the battery terminals and simply connect the junior at the quick disconnect.I have also used the junior to keep a weak car battery going until I could get a replacement installed.', u'The car was parked just outside my garage in the winter.', u'So the junior is plugged inside and the cord ran under the garage door and out to the car.', u'This second one keeps my summer car happy while it is hibernating during winter.', u'I expect it to work just as well as the first junior.', u'If you own a motorcycle or anything else that has a battery and sits a lot you NEED this.', u'Having Battery Tenders has let me extend the life of my batteries at least 3 extra years.', u'Especially if you live somewhere hot like AZ this will keep your batteries from turning into junk over the summer.', u'When I got a second bike I needed a way to keep the batter maintained during the winter.', u\"I wasn't comfortable using my Battery Tender Plus on multiple batteries as it's not a very wise practice.\", u\"So I went with the Jr  as it's considerably cheaper.I think the only difference in the two is the amperage.\", u'The Plus will charge slightly faster.Also the Plus is a box that sits on the floor while the Junior hangs out on the outlet itself.I Purchased this January of 2013 and it still works strong.', u\"I also don't even bother unplugging it from the outlet when I'm not using it.\", u'So it is very reliable.', u'Bought one for each quad, plus a Plus for more versatility (and when I need a quicker charge).', u'I connected the cords to the batteries and zip tied them in place so I just have to plug them in when home.', u\"Don't see why this wouldn't make my batteries last longer, not to mention will cut down on the surprises.\", u'Straight forward charger.', u'I have two motorcycles and they both have their own battery tender.', u'Run smooth all winter, and take very little power.', u'LED shows you quickly if the charger is charging, maintaining, or in fault.', u'I mount the hardwire leads on the bike, in November I plug it in, and it just runs until april/may.', u'Fires up instantly in the spring, no frozen batteries.', u'Easy as can be.', u'Works fine to recharge my fading Harley battery.', u'Seems to reach a full charge faster than specs indicate.Have used it several times, well pleased for price.', u'I bought a cheaper charger first but they changed product design by eliminated the essential second LED indicator.', u'When I plug it in to my car, I have no idea is the charger is working or it just indicate the battery is connected, very dumb.', u'The Batter Tender Junior has 4 modes indication, very useful when connection wire having problem or the charger is not working probably.', u\"This WILL NOT charge your car's battery overnight.\", u\"This will, however, charge your car's battery over a few days to a week without overcharging it.\", u\"This is a great device, and I'd rather have it in my garage than a bigger unit under most conditions.This is because it draws such a small amount of power, it is safe to use with standard extension cords, which is a good thing in a residential garage.\", u'Yes, a bigger charger will charge a battery faster... but it also draws more electricity and amperage, making it a problem for some older residential electrical systems and/or cheap extension cords.', u\"In other words: your battery may charge quickly, but that doesn't matter when your house burns down due to an electrical fire... which will also cost you a few dollars more on the electricity bill smoldering in the mailbox.I've purchased one of these for both of our cars and hook it up with we go out of town on extended vacations.\", u\"It keeps the battery from going flat, which is what it needs to do.You get what's advertised at a great price with the brand reliability of Battery Tender.\", u\"It's that easy.\", u\"I have six of these JR's attached to all my toys,boat batteries,RV batteries, tractor batteries, side by side batteries...you get the point!\", u'No issue and will pay for themselves extending the life of those $100-200 batteries trust me!', u'These Battery Tenders are miracle workers I think for low use vehicles, equipment, and toys.', u\"I've at least half-dozen of these guys in use at given times.I've  hard-wired a pigtail in all low-use 12v battery-started equipment including my diesel pickup and keep on charge while not in use - these keep my batteries healthy.\", u\"They've also rejuvenated many.I figure amount of pocket change spent for charger vs a dead $ulfated battery is enough motivation to purchase and apply.Comes with two pigtail attachments, one made to hardwire  and another with alligator clips - both have fuses and positive-protected connectors.Kyle When a battery is around $100 per these days, even at walmart, you need to get serious about maintaining them.\", u'Nothing but good from mine so far.', u'It works however it takes a long time for the newer batteries for motorcycles.', u'It did keep my battery good through the negative temps recently.', u'The best feature in my opinion is the quick connect.', u'Yes the cheap one at department store has it as well but this one floats instead of trickle charge.', u'I asked a professor at my local college I am attending and he said it is definitely better than trickle charge due to the trickle charge stressing the battery and chancing over charge.', u'The unit does get a little warm not overly though.', u'I highly recommend adding one of the extension cables so that the charger can stay in the house and the cable goes out to motorcycle.', u'I enjoy being able to plug into the bike and then the wall without having to take the panel off to get to the battery.', u'Also there are adapters that will plug into the connector for charging various items while you ride.', u'My opinion worth the money would have given five stars but felt the design was a little plain.', u'It works as advertised.', u'I installed this on my Audi I keep at a vacation house that only gets driven once a month.', u'It comes with two battery mounts - clips and a permanant set.', u'The permanant set installed quickly and easily on the battery - and there is a heavy duty plug witht a cover that I just tuck into the battery holder.', u'It all looks very clean and \"factory installed\".', u'When I leave town I just open the hood an inch - pull out the plug - and plug into the wall unit.', u'A red light indicates it is charging - green light means it is full.', u'All very simply and easy to use - and I never have the hassle of jumping the car or having to use another trickle charger.', u'Purchased this charger and the case (medium size).', u'Both work well and I can trust that this charger will not &#34;over charge&#34; my ATV battery.', u'After using it several time (for maintenance reasons) this charger will completely charge my batter in about 2 1/2 hours.', u'Other type I had to almost 2 days to charge (wall wart type charger).', u'The quality with this charger is far better than most of the other cheap types.', u'Worth it if you need a good charger.', u'ive had this charger for a little over two years...it has saved my live numerous times.', u'easy to use.', u'does what it says, and coudnt be simpler.i could not get my scooter started this a.m.', u'COLD outside.', u'put the charger on, came in, made breakfast and took a shower....went outside and it started right up.', u'glad i did research when i got my scoot about things to have in emergencies....this is a MUST HAVE.', u'This is a great package for carrying on the bike.', u'I connected the battery connector to my terminal and sealed the weatherproof cap over the connection.', u\"I can then easily plug the charger in for trickle or connect the stout battery jumpers to a buddy's bike and get a jump.\", u'Wonderful product I used this over the last winter to keep a charge on my boat and jetski batteries.', u'It works great and kept a charge all winter.', u\"The adapters didn't heat up much passed the initial charging point.\", u'Plugged in my battery last weekend when it hit 75f and hit the water.', u'No issues starting up.', u'Very happy!', u'Use it to tend mower and tractor batteries.', u'Works well.', u\"Haven't used it on larger batteries.\", u'Bought this to replace another brand that failed right out of the package.', u'No quality issues with this one.', u'Works as advertised.', u'Only problem I have had is that sometimes it never goes out of solid red after connecting to the motorcycle, and if I unplug it for a few hours, and then plug it back in, it seems to then go through the correct cycle, ending in green.', u\"This could be the fault of the battery, but I can't know, so I am giving it a 4.5 stars (rounded down from 5 to 4 in this case).\", u\"I also wish the cord were a few feet longer and they used multiple LED's to show status.\", u'Easy hook-up and a number of options for hook up all included.', u'I would recommend these to everyone who needs this.', u\"If you have vehicles that you only run half the year- a motorcycle, or a snowmobile, or a large outboard- it's important to keep the battery charged during the rest of the year, or it'll self-discharge and eventually self-destruct.\", u\"The best way to keep that battery fresh is to bring it indoors and connect an intelligent trickle charger that'll keep it topped off without overcharging.\", u'I have a constantly changing collection of small motorcycles and scooters in my garage and a marine battery that gets used occasionally to run a trolling motor, and to go with them, a small collection of these battery tenders in both 6 and 12 volt models.', u\"They're not terribly expensive, and they work.\", u\"You can also buy multi-charge models like theBattery Tender 021-0128 Battery Tender Plus 12V Battery Chargerthat will handle from two to as many as ten batteries at once, and if you do have more than one battery to maintain, they'e a better deal, and the higher end models are also regulated and temperature controlled.\", u\"If I was starting from zero that's the way I'd go, but I started with just one, and they're all still working, so I have no need to upgrade.\", u'Boy did I need this!', u'I am a new bike owner and I had no idea what a \"tender\" was.', u'I was encouraged to get one by the guy who sold me the bike.', u'This is a very valuable investment.', u'The bike had a brand new battery when I bought it (less than 2 weeks old); however, it has been too cold to ride it regularly.', u\"Of course the battery was about dead on a warm day in February and I wasn't able to ride it.\", u'I keep it on the tender now and I can ride any time I get ready...it works great!', u'I now have 4 Battery Tenders, this being my 2nd Battery Tender Jr.', u'I use the larger models for 2 cars I store each winter, and I use the Jr. models for my generator and my lawn tractor.', u\"Easy to use and work great, I've not yet needed to replace a battery after a storage season.\", u'It does a great job of hold a good charge and then turns off, and just senses the charge and turns back on  when battery starts loosing charge.', u'would wreck amend this product for anybody that has anything that the battery will stay in over the winter or any kind of storage... Michael Very easy to use, extra long cord.', u'Nice price and the unit functions just as stated.', u'It does a very good job of charging and letting you know at what status of charge the battery is at.', u\"It's very simple to use.\", u\"It does a great job and it's very small so easy to pack away when I'm not using it.\", u'I bought three of these for my Harley, lawn tractor, and Cobra show car.', u'I use it only in the winter to maintain battery life.', u'Very pleased I would buy these again.', u'i bought two chargers for my motorcycles.', u'it keeps your personal toys fully charged without overcharging.', u\"the price is right and so far it's been a great device.\", u'i highly recomend this to anyone that has a pleasure ride or vessel that only uses from time to time.', u'AAA+++.', u'I have this item hooked on my motorcycle with the loop connection, so it can be quick hooked or unhooked for summer time.', u'Great, inexpensive, safe, self-regulating device to keep your battery up to snuff.', u'Works like a champ!', u'I have 2 of these for two different vehicles.', u'One has been in use for over 4 years and still going strong.Do wish they included a longer cable for the battery...', u'I really love this thing.', u\"I go on long trips, and I've twice had my batteries die on me within the three year warranty period.\", u\"Since those warranties are pro-rated, and it's a huge pain to drag them back to the store, wait for the test, etc., there's really no advantage to having your batteries die.\", u\"I love the permanent ring terminal to plug set up that I can use to make it easy to hook up the battery charger to my vehicle and then know I don't have to worry about it anymore.Like another reviewer, I have an older BMW with the battery in the trunk.\", u'I just put a small piece of 1 x 2 under the light switch so that the light turns out when I close the trunk.', u\"Since I have waterproof electrical outlets in my garage (for washing cars), I cannot hook this up directly to the wall (because the outlets don't allow it), so I use a thick, outdoor, flat extension cord to go into the trunk, which also eliminates the possibility of damaging the charger's cable.\", u'I can still lock the car doors with the trunk open.I forget the rating, but I have an unusually large battery in that car, and the first time I hooked this charger up, it took more than 24 hours for the light to turn green (which was okay with me).', u\"I use this to keep my wife's car battery charged, since we don't drive it as much as we used to.\", u'I have several I use to keep mower and other batteries charged through the winter.', u\"I've owned some for 20+ years, never had a minutes trouble with any of them.\", u'Installed on a motorcycle works great.', u'Cord included allows for permanent install and can be used for accessories when not charging.', u'Great price.', u\"I now have three of these keeping batteries that aren't used that often charged and kept.\", u'I think it is a good investment batteries are way too expensive to not take care of.', u'Again, these guys are hard to do without.', u'They are doing the job!', u\"I don't buy the 3-pack, I prefer to buy the individuals in quantities of 3 because, for some reason, I get free shipping on the individual ones, but not on the multi pack one.\", u'So, it came out cheaper to buy them a la carte.', u'Go Figure!', u'Solid product with easy understand indicator.Red light = charging and Green = fully charged.I used the charger on a Marine battery.', u\"Took 4 days to charge.I didn't have any problems.\", u'I am very happy with this.', u\"I have two Harley's and pass it back and forth.\", u'I ride all year here in New Jersey but with all the snow and ice this year I have been unable to charge one by riding and the other with the charger.', u'Next year will order another.', u'This is probably the 8th battery tender I have purchased for numerous applications, motorcycles, boat, ATV, etc.', u'Even a 6 volt model for a little Honda CT90.', u'Came securely packaged with all the expected adapters, etc.', u\"Always had great luck with Battery Tender Junior's.\", u'awesome little charger , works out good and comes with good instructions , anyone should be able to hook it up...heck , my wife had it installed on my bike before I could find my keys !', u\"LOL I've had theBattery Tender 021-0128 Battery Tender Plus 12V Battery Chargerfor a long time on my pleasure car.\", u'I had such great luck with it, I picked up this Junior for my lawn mower and tractor.', u'Plugged it in, it charged overnight.', u'It now sits there happily lit up green.', u\"I know my machines are ready to go, and it won't be the battery that prevents them from starting.\", u'What can you say about it, it seems to work.', u'If it keeps my from having to replace the very expensive battery on my Harley as often then its worth the price.', u'This product has a great history of longevity and reliability.Worth every dollar.', u'A great product without question.', u'I do wish the 12volt adapter was included??', u'I have two of these and they do a great job.', u\"The last battery in my '67 Camaro lasted 10 years!\", u'Vey good idea for any car not driven daily.', u'Very compact compared to other chargers on the market, do not have to have some big box to lug around.', u'I love the indication lights when it is charging and complete.', u'Ordered this product for my 2010 HD limited and it already had the connector installed on the bike just plug it in and your bike will have a fully charged battery every time you are ready to ride.', u'Hard to bet the price on this as HD get about 40.00 for the same item.', u'I bought this for my Mom.', u'She has a riding mower that sometimes sits for a long time without use.', u'I used the connectors that you screw onto the terminals and then you have a little plug that you then connect to the charging unit whenever you need.', u'No clamping onto the battery, just plug it in.', u'You can leave this on all the time and it will shut off when the battery is charged coming on only when needed.', u'Safe and easy.', u'Great for over-wintering a battery when you want to keep it charged.Update.', u'I bought one of these for my truck which is not driven very often.', u'I first made sure the battery was charged since it is a heavy duty truck battery.', u'Then I did the screw mount connectors and leave the charger on all of the time.', u'It keeps the battery charged by shutting on and off as needed.', u\"No need to tend it.Can't say enough good about this product for battery maintenance.\", u\"I use this through the season on a couple pieces of power equipment that doesn't get used often and also during winter when I store my batteries indoors (cold climate).\", u'Works good and only draws 12 watts while plugged in.', u'This is my third battery charger for my cars.', u\"This was for my Toyota 4Runner which is 2-wheel drive and doesn't get used much here in Colorado winters.\", u'Keep the battery up to par, so turned over quickly when needed.... Have not used it yet but come this winter I am sure I will appreciate not having a dead battery.', u\"This battery maintainer was the perfect one for me because I don't really need the charging power of the more expensive BatteryTender.\", u'The big part plugs into the wall which keeps it out of the way and keeps it from sitting on wet ground.', u'Green indicator tells you your battery is charged and ready to go.', u\"I've got one hooked to my Trans Am, and another one on my wifes '08 Honda Accord.\", u'We see what happens in June 2011 !', u\"If they work as good as advertised, I'll be getting 2 more for my lawn tractors.\", u'Way cheaper that the manf.', u'site.', u'I use this tender for my toro zero turn mower...used it all winter and took it off and the mower battery started on the first try....Toro even recommends this trickle charger.....I recommend it.', u'We leave our GMC at home while we take our RV to Florida every winter.', u'I leave a battery tender attached to the battery and it keeps the battery at the correct charge rate.', u'Seems to extend the battery life also.', u'Very happy with this one as I have used them for many years now and they have never let me down.', u'I think the marine battery to use as a backup for something and I need to keep it fully charged all the time I selected this item to do that for me.', u'It does an excellent job.', u'There is not a whole lot to say about it you just connected to the battery and plug it in and it works.', u'There are no settings buttons or other things to worry about there are just two LEDs that let you know if it is charging or if it is fully charged.', u'I am very happy with my purchase and I would recommend this item to anybody who wants a good quality battery charger.', u'Does a very good job at keeping the battery fully charged  Using the  included cigarette lighter connection works very well.', u'Quality made.Update 1-30-2010 Upgrade to 5 stars *****Had this unit in operation for over 18 MONTHS now and still working just fine.', u'I use it to keep the two (2) batteries in my 06 Chevy diesel truck charged.', u'The truck is only used to tow my RV so 10 months out of the past year the truck sits stored.', u'(My 08 Malibu gets 33 mpg truck 20mpg mpg hwy WHEN NOT TOWING)  The charger/maintainer has been constantly in use.Update: December 2010:  Unit in constant use for yet another year and still works fine.', u'10 stars!!!', u\"I have this connected to my car's battery (located in the trunk) 24/7/365.\", u'This tender turns off when battery reaches optimal charge.', u'In addition, the tender has a connector so you can connect it to your battery with one easy plug.', u'The tender is extremely convenient and with its led light lets you know if the battery is charged or being charged.', u\"When it's time to drive I simply unplug tender and off I go.\", u'I highly recommend this item.', u'It seems to be well made and is actually maintaining a charge on 2 twelve volts at the same time.', u'The Battery Tender Junior 12V Charger comes complete with everything needed to charge your 12V battery.', u'I purchased this model to specifically charge my motorcycle battery and I am pleased to say that the unit works great.', u'It is a very compact charger and is supplied with several attachments to ensure that your battery is kept in an optimum condition.I made the permanent hard wire attachment to my battery using the color coded leads connected directly to the appropriate positive & negative terminals on the battery.', u'The opposite female end has an end cap which can cover the inlet when not in use.', u\"When I know that I will not be hitting the road for an extended period of time, I simply plug the unit in to maintain my existing battery's power supply.Battery Tender makes larger charging units, but this battery charger is great for charging everything from batteries for ATV's and motorcycles to scooters and lawn mowers.\", u\"Because of it's very discreet size it does not take up any needed space.\", u'I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their battery investment and do not want to compromise space and versatility.', u'Had to replace the one I gave away debated between this and the plus, but seeing as how the plus is larger, not very portable and not waterproof, I chose the JR.Allows for different connections, is portable.', u'Definitely worth it to keep the battery up and running if you have lojack, alarm, or GPS.', u'This is my second battery tender and they are great.', u'I have on on the Harley during the coldest parts of the year and it keeps the battery in perfect condition.', u\"I now have one on our HONDA 3000 generator to keep it's battery up and ready to use.\", u'Have one for all my toys plus a spare.', u'Kept my tractor charged all winter and it started for every snowstorm.', u'Kept it in the shed  and worked fine even below zero I use this little charger to maintain the battery on my lawn

sitting.', u'I have had no issues whatsoever with over-charging or the unit getting overly hot.', u'Works pretty slick and I like the compact size.', u'I could only give it a 4 star rating because I bought it for my lawn mower and ATV battery.', u'It has 2 separate instructions for whether it is left in the vehicle or the battery is removed.', u'I bought this item to keep a battery topped off that has been removed and taken inside from the freezing temps.', u'If battery is removed it says to add a 24&#34;( I think was the length) lead to the negative terminal.', u'Not sure why this needs to be done.', u'I have never done that with a regular full size charger.', u'You get 2 sets of quick disconnect leads, one with clamps and ones you bolt into you vehicle.', u'I would have settled for one lead with a 24&#34; longer negative lead than the positive.', u'Unless you have specific needs, like multiple batteries to charge, or need a much higher charge rate, buy this model, and save yourself some money.This is my 2nd Junior, not because it died on me, but because I accidentally ran over mine in the driveway, and killed it.', u'The old one worked faithfully for years, and through many Wisconsin winters, so there was no question about what to replace it with.I can definitely recommend this.', u'I love this little charger.', u'It comes with a set of leads that I permanantly mounted to my 2007 Kawasaki Vulcan 900 Classic and it makes charging so easy.', u'I highly recommend this \"smart\" charger for anyone with battery charging needs.', u\"My initial intent was for this to keep my motorcycle's battery in good condition while it is in storage during the rainy season.\", u\"However, I have found that it came in handy in a number of occasions.With a red light that tells you its charging a green light that tells you when its just keeping a charge, its simple, small, and very versatile with the 2 connection adapters it comes with.I would definitely recommend this product If you are like me you don't like to buy new batteries.\", u'I use this little charger to keep my motorcycle battery charged.', u'Works very well.', u'I highly recommend.', u'Purchased this Battery Tender for my motorcycle while I have it stored for the winter.', u'A small investment for expensive battery replacement.', u'The unit works great, I also have on for my ATV.', u'Everyone should have one for their toys.', u'Great price and fast shipping from these folks.', u'Should have gotten the waterproof one.', u'But this works really well in tandem with tender 081-0069-6.', u'Keeps my motorcycle battery charged when not in use.', u'Get this one if you have a garage to keep you boat and more batteries charged.', u\"We use 3 different battery tenders on our ATV's and mobility chair.\", u'None are in the same place, and we need the option of different length cords so we can park them where we want and no right next to an electrical outlet.', u'Even with the extension cords these have performed flawlessly--one of them for over 3 years now.', u'We used to go through ATV batteries about every 2 years--by keeping the batteries charged with these devices, they are lasting at least 4 years so far (keeping our fingers crossed).', u\"These things are running 24/7 and we've never had a problem.\", u'This connected easily to my Honda and no more charging needed during the winter to start the bike.', u'Its worth the price.', u'i have a nice late model muscle car that sits in the garage a lot.', u'ive killed two batteries and an alternator from letting it sit.its not good to just unplug the battery as that can mess with the computer.', u'THIS is the answer.', u'definitely worth the $.', u'This battery tender Jr. is great for anything you want to store or have ready for cold winter.The technology is state of the art.I have one Battery tender \"senior\\'which has twice the power to charge my stuff fast,and three Jr\\'s to keep a motorcycle,Gel battery Miata,and emergency generator in check.The jr\\'s have half the \"juice\",but unless you want a faster charge(8hrs vs. 16 hrs on a dead battery,you can do just fine with the Jr\\'s.A couple things to note.The Jr\\'s come with aligator clips and ring clips,the Senior only comes with ring clips,so make sure you add the alligator clips with your order.Keep in mind every battery is in a different state of service,depending on age etc., so make sure you check the battery after about 6hrs the first time you use the tenders.If the battery is warm,you probably want to keep close watch on your charging,its probably the battery.Packaging and delivery are as good as can be(Amazon direct).Get one soon ,or two or three!', u'Durable quality and fair price.', u\"I have a custom-built trailer with built-in battery to power emergency lights that I tow behind a motorcycle; it's been fitted with a harness so that, hooked to a 117VAC outlet, either the internal U1P-7 battery or the motorcycle battery can be charged.\", u'The trailer was originally fitted with a charger which I had very little confidence in; I\\'ve substituted the Battery Tender Junior which both frees up space (it\\'s much smaller, about 40% the size of the original) and gives me some confidence that neither of the batteries will be \"cooked\" by overcharging.', u'The Battery Tender Juniors have a deserved reputation for reliability and durability; battery-charge cycle tests over the past 24 hours have confirmed my opinion that the Junior is the right choice for this application.', u\"I do wish that the manufacturer had provided a way to anchor it to a wall or floor so that I need not concern myself with making sure that it's properly mated to the outlet before I begin the charging cycles, but I can live with that small shortcoming.\", u\"The battery tender is a MUST for any vehicle with a battery that doesn't get driven every day.\", u'It keeps the batteries fresh and makes them last WAY longer than they would otherwise.', u\"It's a pretty small investment that will pay for itself in no time even saved a battery that was dying.\", u'i was using a cheap schumacher charger that seemed to be killing more batteries than it charged.', u'i took that off and started using this one on a battery that was starting to not hold a charge, and it came back to life.', u\"now it works fine, didn't need to replace.\", u\"seeing as how these aren't expensive, i think they''re a great bargain.\", u\"especially if you don't need multiple banks or anything.\", u'This is a great little unit.', u'Using it to charge a 18 amp hour SLA for a portable device.', u'Have been using it for a month now with no complaints.', u'Would recommend for same type of use.', u'It works.', u\"And it's highly recommended - my local battery store has a wall full of them - I found out AFTER buying it here.\", u\"Small, with enough connectors/cables for a variety of uses, it's at a good price point to buy and hook into my son's car as it sits over the winter while he's doing semester abroad.\", u'Great little device for keeping my car truck or winter snow plow riding tractor batteries up to starting in the cold weather .', u'I have other brands of maintainers but this brand works as good if not better than them.', u'Very good product that works as advertised.', u'Easy hookup, maintenance free operation, go-no go operation.', u'LED indicators tells you if your set up is correctly polarized.', u'I use to keep my spare battery in the garage charged for using 12 volt items instead of using my cars for the power.', u'This little beauty keeps my motorcycle battery charged all of the time.', u'I love it and the compact size makes it easy to bring along.', u'Recieved as expected and in a timely manner.', u'4 stars, nothing deserves 5 stars that is perfect but this was pretty close.', u'I have used various battery tenders and I will rate this one with the best.', u'It is in use all the time.', u'I am going to get another for the mower battery for the winter.', u'I have ordered two of these for several projects and they are great!', u'I would recommend them to anyone who is needing a charger for a battery... Charged my battery no problem.', u'The lights on the charger let you know when the battery is at almost charged and turns green when it is completely charged.', u'Worked well with my newly installed battery.', u'For reference I used it one Yuasa battery and have had no problems so far.', u'I took the battery out to charge it which seemed the easiest way to do it.', u\"It does what it says it does; I have a weak scooter battery and this keeps it going day to day, but here's the amazing part; I had a cut milk jug that I had drained my oil into.\", u'It was sitting in our breezeway.', u'Somehow, the plug from this ended up in the oil WHILE it was still plugged in.', u'It sat there for probably 1.5 to 2 days.', u\"All it did was blink red (basically indicated that it was trying to charge the oil but couldn't quite get there).\", u'That made me a believer.', u'I use this thing on all my equipment  in the winter...as batteries get older and hold charge less efficiently, I use them in the summer too.', u'It certainly is nice just hopping on the equipment and having it start.']\n"

all-time favorites.It applies very easily provided the car is in the shade (black cars plus sunlight = a surface that's way too hot for any wax).\", u\"I'm especially pleased with the packaging - it comes in a tube much the same as toothpaste.\", u'The wax itself is gray colored and thick, and the tube makes it very easy to dispense without any mess or wastage.', u'Very well done!It can be applied with a buffer, but I just applied it by hand using the included applicator (a round piece of foam).', u'Very easy to apply.It buffs off easily after letting ir dry to a haze.', u'I used a

u'Way happy with this stuff.', u'Really easy to apply with a DA and leaves a wonderful mirror like coat.', u\"I'd imagine the chemical guys setup for black cars is better but this stuff is like 1/4

am afraid.After waxing the car, the defects may still be there but they are hidden by a strong glossy finish that makes the black car paint like a mirror.', u'It is a very pleasant finish.', u'It is worth noticing that the tube was not completely used up in the operation so it should be enough for a large SUV.I still have to add that while I was passing the few remaining passes with the cloth for a perfect shine, I felt the hair on my forearm react to static electricity.', u'As well, the car got covered with what may look like dandruff coming out of the dried wax itself and maybe bits of the microfiber cloth I was using.', u\"They all flew away as I drove to refill my tank.I will not have to wash my car and wax it soon again hopefully but I am happy that I did not waste my time.I would defintiely recommend Meguiar's G6207 Black Wax.\", u'I have a black Lexus and the shine is great.', u'I only use Meguiar product on my cars and never have been disappointed  Another great Meguiar product.', u'I am reading some reviews that claim that its not that great since it did not remove the scratches.', u'Well I detail cars for a living and products like this \"enhance\" not fix.', u'If you want to fix your scratches you would need to spend a lot more and pick the right compounds and polishes, not to mention you would need a good DA polisher and pads.', u'Meguiars have the M105 and M205 to fix scratches.', u'Megs black brings out the true luster of dark cars after paint has been corrected giving it that wet car show shine.', u'works great and easy to use.', u'removed lots of swirl and haze from our black TSK...leaves no residue, easy on and easy off...very pleased with this product..', u\"I've been using paste wax for the past 30+ years and I appreciate how it provides a beautiful finish.\", u'This is the first time I\\'ve used a \"black wax\" and it does do a nice job.I used Meguiar\\'s Black Wax on my 1996 black Honda Civic.', u'The hood is quite scratched up by now so I thought this might be a good test to see what effect it had on a scratched up surface.', u'I wish I could attach the photos I took.', u\"I put Meguiar's on the right (driver's side) and Turtle Wax on the left (passenger side).\", u\"Both look great, but I'd give the Meguiar's black wax just a shade more credit for a slightly nicer, darker mirror finish.I really like the tube, it is easier than dipping the applicator into a tin.\", u'I also really like that it doesn\\'t leave behind \"white dust\".This is a very nice product!', u'(I will try to upload some photos to the main product page.)', u\"I have an 09 Range Rover and wash it every week....wax 1x's a month.\", u'Changed to t his wax and it was a very very noticeable difference.', u'I am very happy... looks showroom new now...very shiny and deep black.', u\"I was using Turtle Wax &#34;black box&#34;, which is also great... but this single application product from meguiar's is really fantastic.\", u\"As with all liquid(ish) wax, let it dry... let it dry a long time.... and you're going to get great results.\", u\"While the title says 'black wax' it can also be use on lighter colored cars.\", u'Of course, you need the paint surface to be prepped and cleaned otherwise your effort of waxing will be in vein.', u'it has slight/small cleaning property, using the correct pad and speed, it will remove light swirls.', u\"gloss?probably on par or slightly lower than the meg's mirror glaze #7, but the advantage of this is it has sealant property.\", u\"If you have a new car and it is dark colored, you won't be dissappointed!\", u'Longevity?last about 4-6 weeks roughly~ I purchased this and used it once, it worked so good I bought another tube the same day.', u'Works great with DA polisher, I bought the Harbor Freight DA with a finishing pad and left a deep black glossy shine.', u'So much easier than hand buffing.', u'A little goes a long way.', u'I am very happy that this product produced the results it promises.', u'The swirl marks on my black Kia Sorrento are completely gone and the car looks showroom new.', u'I have recommended this to all my friends with black cars.', u'I used the included foam applicator and some cheap microfiber towels from Wal-mart for polishing.', u\"I can't imagine better results are possible any other way.\", u'It took some elbow grease to get the job done, but the results are well worth it.', u'I am anxious to see how long it lasts.', u\"So far, we've driven through a couple horrendous downpours and the dried dust and dirt wipes off easily.\", u\"I'm lucky to have a garage, so I'm hoping I'll get through the summer and fall with a pretty great shine.This is the product to use on your black car.\", u'1995 Eldorado with original deep candy apple red paint, essentially always garaged and the paint looks great although it has picked up some light micro-scratches after years of hand washing.', u\"I had to choose between Meguiar's offering of a white wax for light colored cars, or this black wax .\", u'.', u'.', u'I went with the black.The product comes in the old-fashioned metal (not plastic tube).', u'Has about the consistency of toothpaste and goes on and buffs off easily enough.', u'And with this \"black wax\", I was not making endless circuits around the car cleaning up those wax residue white spots that seem to mysteriously emerge for hours in cracks and crevices.', u'This stuff is more work (obviously) than a spray wax but not difficult to buff off like some of those old paste waxes.', u'Results??', u'.', u'.', u'.Looks super.', u'Nice deep shine, slick as oiled glass, and even on this red (not black) car, the micro paint scratches and swirls seem to have disappeared.', u'Has only been on about 10 days, with the car garaged.', u'One 100 mile drive in the rain and a machine touchless car wash and, as one would expect, rinse water was beading and running off superbly.Nice product.', u\"If it deteriorates quickly, I'll come back and edit my review to reflect that.\"]\n"

      "[u\"I've had several tire pressure gauges over the years, the last two of which being digital.\", u'The Michelin Gauge is a good, reasonably well built model that should last for years.Pros:-Well built-Long battery life-Easy to read-Relatively easy to mount on tireCons:-non-AA/AAA battery-Easy to lose too much air when fumbling around for a tire pressure indication I like the build quality and the look of the gauge.', u'The pouch is a nice addition.', u'My car has 245/40/18 tires, and I did not have any problems with how the gauge attaches to the valve (see pic).', u'I like that the goal tire pressure can be programmed into the gauge while allowing separate settings for front and rear tires.', u'I also like the little flashlight feature.', u'It is bright enough for finding the valve in the dark.', u'My only concern is that batteries might be dead on the day when you really need to use it.', u'This is why I am not ready to throw away my low-tech stick pressure gauge.Overall, I think this gauge works and would make a nice present.', u'This is a well made pressure checker with an easy to read display.', u'The example I received is spot on in terms of accuracy, as well.', u'I compared its readings to a very precise professional dial gauge.The gauge is easy to hold and is coated in a soft non-slip finish which is pleasing to the touch.', u'The display, as mentioned, is large and easy to read.', u'While the gauge is programmable for the desired pressure, I find myself just using it as a direct reading gauge.', u'It comes with a nice zippered soft case which will help keep it clean when not in use.My only criticism, and the reason for only four stars, is that the pressure probe is not angled.', u'In order to use this gauge, you must have the full length of the gauge in which to maneuver.', u\"It will work fine for most car tires, but some motorcycle tires don't have angled valve stems (pointed outboard) and therefore it will be difficult, or impossible, to maneuver this gauge for a tight fit to the valve stem and achieve a solid reading.Notwithstanding the criticism above, I like this gauge very much and use it often, despite that one limitation.\", u'This is a very nice gauge.', u'First off it is easy to read.', u'Next you can set the PSI for both the front and the back most cars today have a differant psi for the front and the back so u just set it and when you check it you just hit the set button and it tells you where you need to be and it is very accurate I checked it with our gauges at work and it was right on the money!!', u'The best part is u can change the batteries which is very handy as with most other gauges you just through them away!!', u'This is a cool tire gauge.', u\"the Michelin MN-4357B is very easy to read, and quite accurate, but is very difficult to seed to the stem and requires a lot of pressure to keep the thing tight, so you can get a good reading.It is not at all useful if you don't have a straight shot to your valve stem.\", u'Trucks or something with angled valve stems or are in tight quarters, this would not be useful at all.The backlight feature and the PSI vs. millibar readout is useful.', u\"The case is really nice.But, if you have quick and easy access, and don't mind the seeding issues, it's very accurate.\", u'This tire gauge worked for me about as good as most others I have tried.', u'Some air leaks out when I first push it onto the valve stem but I quickly learned the correct angle.', u'This can be an annoyance so I deducted a star for that, the gauge should have a steeper angle to fit valve stems better.', u'Overall, the gauge was accurate, has a clear display and is easily stored in a glove compartment.', u\"The small light is a nice touch but I don't usually check my tire pressure at night.\", u'The quality seems to be good, it has a one year warranty.', u'This gauge is about as simple to use as a manual gauge: Press set, and when the display appears, press the gauge against the tire valve.', u'The display will hold the setting until you press set again.', u'Simple.', u'I tested it against my expensive mechanical gauge, and they agreed to within a pound.', u'Simple.', u'It uses lithium button cells, rather than AAA cells, which means the batteries will last for a long time.', u\"It comes in a nice storage case that should protect it from getting banged around in the glove compartment.There's an interesting, though somewhat complicated, memory function that allows you to store two reference pressures, one for your front wheels and one for the rear.\", u\"I played around with it for a bit, but it's really unnecessary as (1) my main car has the same tire pressure at all four wheels and (2) you can find the tire pressure on a sticker inside the door jamb on just about every car made.\", u'Too dark to see the sticker?', u'The gauge has a built in flashlight, too.', u'With a price less than a lot of mechanical gauges, I think this gauge is a very good value.', u'This item works excellent.', u'The pull tab for the battery broke when pulled leaving the insulator on the battery.', u'Had to open to remove it.', u'Other than that the item preforms great!']\n",

      "[u\"I've done 3 oil changes on my BMW 330xi with this vacuum, and its still going strong.\", u\"It removes oil quickly and without mess.I've been cleaning mine out with gasoline after i use it.\", u'Im not sure if this will make the vac last longer, but im hoping so.', u'Definitely worth $80.', u'I bought this back in march 2009, and have had nothing but flawless oil changes with it.In that time I have performed two lawn mower oil changes, and five car oil changes with this device.', u'(Yes.', u'I put a lot of miles on my car.', u')On the VW I use a fumoto valve instead of a traditional drain plug.', u'My Oil filter housing is also designed with a nipple allowing oil extraction.', u'This combination allows me to draw oil out of the car quickly and easily with a vacuum device such as this.', u'The Mityvac draws 5w40 and 0w40 out of the car in roughly seven minutes.Many would consider that slow.', u\"However I don't have to spend time torquing a drain bolt down, jacking up the car, or sloshing an oil container around.\", u'Oil changes are easily half the time they used to be, and far cleaner.For oil disposal I simply reverse the flow on the Mityvac and put the oil in a multi gallon vessel.Before I bought this device I was worried about implosion: I prefer to change oil when it is warm or nearly operating temperature hot.', u'So far I have had no problems.', u'Bought it for oil extraction from a Mercedes and a SeaDoo.', u'Works great.', u'Also works for draining diffs, transfer cases, or transmissions before removing pans etc.', u'It can be kind of annoying to clean out but beats dealing with drain pans in hard to reach areas.', u\"As the instructions say don't over pump.\", u\"10 pumps or so and just let it do it's thing.\", u'The last thing you would want is for the reservoir to collapse in on you.', u'I was apprehensive because of the reviews with people saying theirs only worked once..', u\"But I get the feeling that they didn't understand how the thing works.\", u'You can easily damage the components by using it wrong.', u\"You pump the thing 3-4 times per quart, but you don't want to sit and pump while you're removing the fluids, that isn't how it works.\", u'Pump it a 3-4 times and wait for it to get done, then do it again.', u'It goes pretty fast!', u'I did my brakes, trany, oil, power steering, transfer case, and differential before pulling the plug to get the rest and not make a mess and radiator fluid on a couple different vehicles.. went smoothly.', u'I recommend buying a half inch hose clamp for the rubber reducer.', u'After reading all the various reviews on this, I knew I was taking a risk on the purchase but decided to roll the dice to see if it was my lucky day.First of all, I did not purchase this through anyone currently listed as a seller on Amazon, but the source is a very popular tool supplier that is listed for many other tools on amazon.', u'The priced was only about $4.00 more than the best listed.The mityvac arrived inside a sturdy shipping box that originated from Mityvac.', u'Inside this box, the 7201 was nested inside its own box with a protective card board sleeve over the top of the handle.', u'It arrived undamaged.Per the supplied instructions, I checked the screws in the upper lid to ensure they were tight (they were).', u\"I'm not sure if it came with a gasket under the lid that so many had stated was missing on some units.\", u'It worked, so why bother with taking the lid off.I tested the evaucation action by drawing a gallon of antifreeze inside the 7201.', u'It did this quickly with only a few pumps of the handle.', u'So far so good.Next, I tested the refilling capability by returning the antifreeze back into the one gallon container.', u'It did this quickly and very throughly leaving only about 1 oz in the botton of the reservoir.', u'Very very good.The supplied tubing is very rigid and I plan to replace it with some flexible hose from a local hardware store.I give this a 5 star rating.', u'Sturdy and well made.', u'This thing is well worth it overall.', u\"It's not going to work for every vehicle, however.\", u'My Corolla and my Yukon are both apparently not compatible with the down-the-tube method of oil removal.', u\"For my Crown Vic, and my pre-80's cars, it's simply outstanding.It pulls an amazing amount of oil from the pan, just have to fish around a little with the hose after you get most of the oil out, in order to find any small pockets of oil remaining.\", u'After about 3-4 minutes of suction, I removed the drain plug and checked.', u'I only got a tablespoon or so of drip, which is pretty good, overall.', u\"Transmission oil is just as easy, but I think you'd be better off slightly elevating the front/rear/side in order to force fluid toward the dipstick because the pans are usually flatter/shallower.Quick, easy, and you can just pump it right back into the empty oil container.\", u\"You're still going to get some on you...Finally, my one complaint, there is no way to securely fasten the hose and adapter fittings to the pump when it's not in use.\", u'Minor, but irritating, since the little friction clip is pretty much useless if you bump the hose out.', u'The fittings disappeared into the garage somewhere, since I set them aside while I pumped out the oil.', u'Would be much better to have a little plastic compartment on the side/base of the pump to drop those into.', u'Had to adapt a fuel line to use as an adapter.Would definitely buy again, and recommend to friends.', u'Love it.', u'I have been using oil extractors for a few years now, namely the Pela 6000 marine pump.', u\"Although I am well experienced with cars, I currently have my oilpan drain plug replaced with a temperature sensor, so I prefer not to remove that and risk damaging, plus, I hate having to get under the car and pray not to spill oil everywhere.The Pela pump was great, the big issue was that there was no easy way to drain the container and if you weren't careful, while draining you would tip too far and cause an air bubble which made oil dump out with some force and splash everywhere (think of turning a 2liter bottle upside down).\", u'Unfortunately I had to toss out the pump because it was starting to leak some oil out of the handle.I read some great things on automotive forums about the Mityvac, and was ecstatic to find this particular model that can not only pump, but easily evacuate fluid as well.', u'This comes in real handy when dealing with fluids such as brake fluid and transmission fluid.', u'On top of that, it provided me a VERY easy way to extract oil from the pump back into the bottles ;).The pump worked like a charm, and did exactly what it is intended to do.', u'This is great for my car because although the car holds about 5 quarts of oil, conventional draining from the pan only drains out about 4 quarts as oil is still left in the oil coolers.', u'Because of the vacuum that this produces inside of the oil sump, I manage to evacuate almost every drop of oil from the system.One note is that you MUST tighten the screws holding on the top cover.', u'They are a tad loose when you get the pump, but can easily be tightened and you do not have to worry about the leaking that others have experienced.', u'Use this for oil changes on my Subaru BRZ and it works great.', u'Just stick the extension that has a smaller tube size right into the dip stick tube.', u'This is basically a manual vacuum to suck up oil or other liquids from inside your engine or other places where oil or fluids are used.', u'It includes everything you need and works pretty well, although sicking up 4-5 quarts can be a little slow, so be patient.', u\"I use it for oil changes so I don't need to always undo the drain plug and replace the compression washer (don't forget to replace the filter too!).\", u\"I've heard so many horror stories about damage to the threads on the oil pan drain plug from over tightening that I decided to reduce the number of times I go there.\", u\"That's where this Fluid Evacuator comes in.\", u'Warm up the engine a little, turn everything off, slip the straw like hose down the dip stick hole and suck up the oil.', u\"Change the filer and refill the oil and you're done.\", u\"For me that means I don't have to remove panels under the car to access the oil pan drain plug and I don't have to put the car up on stands.\", u'Those both take a lot of time, so this evacuator is a great time saver.', u\"The tank is big enough to hold the oil from my larger car's engine and when the tank is full, the Mityvac can be put into reverse and pump out the contents too, so you don't need to pour out the tank.It includes several different diameter &#34;straws&#34; that are designed to slip down the dipstick hole or other filler holes (like on a differential).\", u'Those straws connect to clear piping so the Evacuator can be standing on the garage floor.Remember that oil and similar liquids flow best when warm.', u\"However, don't get the fluids hot and don't run the motor with the straw inserted!\", u'I read about someone who did that and the meshing gears pulled the straw into them, causing the motor to stall and needed to take apart the engine to get the straw out!', u\"!About my only complaint with the Evacuator is I wish it had more strays since I'd also like to drain the radiators using this but don't want to use the oily motor oil straw where oil isn't wanted in the radiator.\", u'Otherwise this is a great tool to have available.', u'Keep in mind that it does require a dip stick hole for  sucking up the oil, so if you have a newer Porsche or similar car with a digital dipstick, you may not be able to use this.', u\"Check on forums for you car if you're unsure.\"]\n"

very non standard voltage.Would give it 5 stars, if it had a more standard 2 prong or 3 prong standard wall outlet plug for charging.', u'but overall.', u'its good to have in the trunk for those just in case moments.', u'I used this little guy on a dead battery in a Corvette and it cranked it over with no problem and fired up in seconds.', u'I will keep this in the car and it is smaller and weighs

with holding a charge while being left in a vehicle.', u\"Small and compact, so doesn't take up to much room.\", u'I ordered this product to jump my second vehicle -- which due to the bad economy my wife and I are storing in the garage to save on insurance and also state license fees.', u'However I want to keep the car in run-ready condition, so I try to start it every couple weeks or so.', u'But I usually forget a time or two and the battery dies.That was the incentive behind my purchase of the Jump N Carry.', u'And I can tell you it is a perfect little device.', u\"Not very big (and not terribly heavy), it's very easy to clamp onto your car battery.\", u\"So far my car has started on the first attempt (been used twice now).When not jumping my stored car, we keep the Jump N Carry in the trunk of our main car -- just in case we need it or some other motorist needs a jump.I recommend this product.EDIT: March 16, 2011After one full year in the trunk, I just tested the battery and it's at 75 percent.\", u'Impressive!', u'The only product feature I see now would be helpful would be to have the plug to charge this unit built-in.', u\"It's an extra charger -- and I've seem to have misplaced it.\", u'A retractable plug would be perfect.', u'We have tested a few chargers for fleet use - this being the best one I tested.I have a fleet of Ford E250 vans, mostly 2004, 2006-2008 models.', u'I have jumped at least 10 vans with this on a single charge.', u\"The 10th van had zero juice in the battery (not enough to even dimmly power the cab light or even get a flicker on the dash), and it fired right up without any charge time.My ONLY complain is the charger leads do not grip well onto GM side post batteries (we have some '02 and '04 GMC 2500 vans as well).\", u'It works but you have to work to make a connection.This jumps far better than some other brands we have tried and I am recommending that we purchase several more for our fleet.', u'Small package, well made, external 12V plug a plus.', u'I bought this unit to use remotely with a portable compressor I had purchased.', u'The 12V round plug worked great for this application.', u\"The provided 12V plug in light was a little hokey (cheap) but I didn't buy this for the light.\", u\"Haven't used it to start a car yet.\", u'Bought this for my father inlaw who loves this jump box.', u'Its small and light enough to carry around yet more than powerful enough to jump start any car.', u\"I've had 2 of these now for almost 1 year and getting another now.\", u\"I'm keeping one in each car now and a backup in my garage.\", u\"I've used it to jump my Honda Pilot more than 20 times over the past year.\", u'Kids leave lights on mainly.', u\"I don't worry anymore.- It takes me &#60;1min to pull this out, hook up and jump my car.- The battery lasts forever it seems.\", u\"after 10 jumps still shows full power, but I charge it to full every few months just in case as I know with lead acid batteries if you get too low, it will create buildup and reduce effectiveness over time.- i've kept in my hot garage and inside my car without trouble (i keep it under some sheets in my car to prevent it from being exposed to direct sunlight).\", u\"haven't noticed any problems or leakages over the year.I initially didn't believe it would work so well, but now I recommend it strongly to anyone as a backup.\", u'Never be stranded again.', u'We now have three of these units,one for each car.', u'It is a real comfort having this item in your car especially during the pastwinter in New Jersey.', u'I have also assisted other drivers during their time of need.', u'After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to pick one up as a Christmas present for my elderly parents so they had something on hand to jump start their Honda Accord if it was ever needed.', u'As of yet, of course, I have not had the opportunity to try it out.', u'However, I did do a bench test using the 12V adapter plug.I used a 120V converter outlet to plug into where the flashlight is.', u'This enabled me to plug in a lamp.', u'I was amazed to find that it kept a 40 watt CFL bulb powered for 7 hours!', u'This unit is perfect for the unexpected power outage.', u'I wish I had found this unit much earlier on before I bought the Duracell 450 and 300 units.', u'It is so much lighter, less cumbersome and bulky.', u'It is also at the fraction of the price than the Duracell Powerpack units.Some side notes:  This unit does not have any indication as to when it is fully charged, other than to look and see that all 3 green lights are lit.', u'It states in the manual it should be fully charged within 3 hours, but should not be kept plugged in for more than 24 hours.', u'So, the owner must remain vigilant during the charging process or damage to the battery may occur.The final 3rd remaining green light WILL blink when the unit is low on power.', u'This is a nice feature so you can prevent depleting the battery to the point of damage.', u'I am unsure if it has an internal cut off to prevent this from happening, but I do not want to take that risk.There is another variation of this model at a lower price.', u'It is yellow and I believe it has thicker jumper cables.', u'I am going to buy one of them next for my own home purposes after Christmas.', u'If anyone has any feedback on that one, I welcome anyone to leave a comment.', u'It is appreciated.Be confident, buy this unit!']\n"

      "[u'I have been using this gauge 3 times a week for a year now.', u\"It's wonder because the battery lasts for a long time and it measures my psi accurately.\", u'I have found this to be a accurate and easy to use digital tire pressure gauge.', u'Easy to use and comes with a nice case.', u'A great item to have in your workshop as well as your vehicle.', u'I would recommend this item to anyone that is looking for a accurate and inexpensive digital tire gauge.', u'To me air pressure in the tires is vital.', u'I do check all 4 tires cold in the morning before driving at least once a week.', u\"I had one made in Germany meter very expensive I bought at Le Mans but lost it and replaced it with this one.I need to know the tires are 100% properly inflated specially since I sometimes drive my BMW at over 250 MPH, need to be certain.Go for it, you'll love it it feels indeed very expensive.\", u'AmazonBasics Programmable Digital Tire GaugeThis tire gauge looks exactly like the newer Accu-Tire programmable gauge.', u'The first thing you should understand is that the programmable aspect is just a reminder.', u\"Whether you actually program the gauge is not significant, I found that it doesn't really serve a purpose when I use the gauge on 4 different cars and a motorcycle which all have different tire pressures.\", u'For instance, one car has 32 psi front/rear while the motorcycle is supposed to be filled to 32.9 psi in the front and 36.9 psi in the rear.', u'This Amazon tire gauge only reads tire pressure in increments of 0.5 psi, just like other digital tire gauges.The Amazon gauge is rather large, heavy, and bulky.', u'There are rubberized coatings on some parts of the gauge to provide a better grip.', u'It automatically reads the tire pressure when you hook it up to a Schrader valve on a tire.', u\"It quickly resets, but not so quickly that you don't have time to register the reading.\", u'The SET button allows you to manually reset it for the next reading.I compared the readings on this gauge with myCampbell Hausfeld AU110000AV 99 PSI Key Chain Digital Tire Gauge, and they matched exactly.', u'I compared the readings to that of the on-board TPMS on one of my Chevy cars and it was within 1 psi.My biggest complaint with the Amazon gauge is the \"release valve\".', u'I purchased this thinking there was an actual release button so I could release air and check the readings in real-time.', u'Unfortunately, it is just a machined nub that pushes in the Schrader valve on your tires.', u\"The seal on the gauge isn't that great and requires careful alignment to ensure no leaks.That said, the release valve nub came in handy.\", u\"I have a set of tires on a car that have Schrader valves with really short stems that don't seem to accept the ends of the caps or even my finger nails.\", u'The nub on this Amazon gauge was able to release the air without any problems.The Amazon gauge was also perfectly compatible with all of my vehicles, and the swivel top allows you to use it in odd/hard to reach locations.', u'The backlit LCD display is also easy to read as long as you keep the display at a flat angle to your face.', u'Apparently the polarization is very strong because if I tilted it a few degrees away from my face in any direction, the text disappears.The Amazon gauge comes with a semi-rigid zippered case that makes it handy to keep in your glove box or in a purse/bag, or a tool kit.', u'The instruction manual states that it uses a pair of CR2032 lithium coin-cell batteries, which are more resilient against temperature extremes and have a decent storage life (3-5 years).Overall: 4/5 stars, rather pricey but seems to be very ruggedized.', u'Swivel top makes it versatile enough to reach all odd-ball valve locations.', u\"I honestly could live with using my cheap Campbell-Hausfeld keychain gauge even though it isn't as fancy as this Amazon gauge.\", u'Also, it looks like this gauge is just a rebranded Accu-Tire gauge.', u'I love this little gadget.', u\"It's heavy duty, well designed, feels solid in your hand.\", u\"The head swivels as needed, and there's even a built-in light.\", u'Nice bright led display with large numbers, easy to read.', u'Comes in a very nice padded case, so it will be safe to store in your trunk or glove box, or anywhere in your garage.', u\"Very nice quality, I'm impressed!\", u'I got tired of those \"pencil\" gauges that hardly ever are accurate.', u'And such a pain to use.', u'You can easily push this on and wait to not hear the hiss of escaping air and then the pressure is easy to read.Those complaining about not being able to figure out how to program it was not an issue for me.', u'I know what the tire pressure is supposed to be so I never intended to \"program\" it.I do have one observation however.', u\"I have a TPMS on my 5th wheel and it's readouts on all four tires are 3 pounds less than this gauge.\", u'I tried another gauge I had and it said about the same readout as this gauge.', u\"Now, I'm concerned.\", u'Could the usually reliable TPMS be off or is it this gauge.', u'At least the TPMS even if 3 pounds less would still let me know of any pressure/temperature issue.', u'I am a fanatic about maintaining the pressure in my tires.', u\"I also follow MY recommended pressures, not the manufacturer's (I run a few psi over spec).\", u'Add to that that I live in a temperate zone, as most all of us in North America do... and I get a lot of use from tire pressure gauges.I have used digital, graduated stick type, and high accuracy dial type over the years.', u\"Each has it's advantages (although a stick type's only advantage is that it fits in your pocket easily, as they are not very accurate).\", u'But I like the combination of accuracy and ease of use provided by a good digital gauge.', u\"Easier to read, and often easier to use.This gauge is the best I've ever had - at far below the price of some I've owned.\", u'It takes only seconds to register your pressure, which is displayed in large numbers with an illuminated back screen.', u'It holds the reading for 10 seconds.', u\"The angle of the head and size of the unit are well designed, making it easier to make good contact with the valve stem than many others I've used (nothing I hate more than bleeding air while trying to get a good seal with a gauge).\", u'There is even a small LED flashlight feature that is useful if you are trying to work in the dark.You can pre-set the desired pressures for your front and rear tires into the gauge to serve as a reminder.', u\"These setting don't actually perform any function (such as telling you how much over/under you are), which would be a nice design upgrade... but it is useful for those who don't easily remember the prescribed pressures.The bleeder side of the head (used to let air out of the tires) is a little awkward to use, due to the angle.\", u'But it is still useful.', u'The case for the gauge is actually very nice and zips closed.', u'It has enough padding to protect the gauge, should it be dropped on the road or garage floor.', u'The feel of the tool is good - very ergonomic.', u'I rate this gauge five stars because it excels at everything I need in a tire pressure gauge, and the odd bleeder angle is not enough of a problem to take away a star.', u'I love it!', u'Easy to read; light and portable; very nice durable case.', u'Can be set to remember the correct pressure.', u'Highly recommended.', u'I saw this gauge and I had to jump all over it.', u'It was an identical clone to an old faithful Sears Craftsman design - down to the screen an LED lamp.', u\"They stopped selling that one about 5 years ago and went to a new design, and I was forced to use inferior gauges.It's accurate, easy to use, with the swiveled head, and easy to carry on the motorcycle in a pouch.The carrying case is also helpful too to insulate it against temperature extremes (more the sun shining directly on it.\", u'THE PRODUCT ARRIVED ON TIME AND IN PERFECT CONDITION.', u'THE READOUT IS LARGE ENOUGH AND CLEAR AND THE SWIVEL HEAD PROVIDES EASY VIEWING FROM ANY POSITION OF THE VALVE STEM.', u'MY 2 STAR RATING IS BECAUSE AFTER CHECKING MY FIRST TIRE, THE VALVE FITTING CAME OFF OF THE GAUGE.', u'I DID NOT WANT TO GO THROUGH THE HASSLE OF EXCHANGING IT SO I SUPER GLUED IT ON AND IT HAS HELD, AND IT WORKS.', u'FOR WHAT LOOKS TO BE A WELL MADE GAUGE, I WAS DISAPPOINTED.FOLLOW-UP 6/8/13  I CHANGED MY RATING FROM 2 STARS TO 5 STARS BECAUSE I WAS SENT A REPLACEMENT AND IT IS WORKING PERFECTLY AND HAS NOT FALLEN APART.', u\"I'm quite picky about keeping tire pressures right where I want it.\", u'Naturally, I check PSI at least once a month, and whenever we have a sudden temperature drop.', u\"I've had plenty of vehicles with onboard PSI read-outs, but those are by no means 100% accurate.\", u'So having a good tire gauge is very important.', u'My current \"go to\" gauge was theAccutire MS-4021B Standard Digital Tire Gauge.', u'It was basic, as it only provided the PSI, no LED light, buttons, etc.', u'But it worked.', u'I never had issues with getting a seal.', u'The one I wanted to be my favorite is theAccutire MS-4350B Programmable Digital Tire Gauge.', u'That had all of the features I liked such as a light, back-lit display, memory for tire pressures, etc.', u\"But, it wouldn't always get a good seal with every tire.\", u'Some worked well, others, not so much.Then along comes the Amazon Digital Tire Gauge.', u'It basically combines all of the features I want/need, and then some.', u\"You have a swivel head (no more awkward angles), air-bleed knob on the back, back-lit display, LED light, and memory that will let you store front/rear tire PSI so you don't have to dig around your owners manual or check a dirty door jamb.I was skeptical it could do everything it claims, and do so reliable.\", u\"So I've been using this for about a month between various vehicles and every tire I could get my hands on to get a solid feel for it.\", u'After all, not all air stems are created equal.', u\"But I'm pleased to report that it's been working perfectly.\", u'It always gets a solid seal and I don\\'t have to keep moving it around to prevent air leakage.Pros:* Rotating head* Back-lit LCD* Programmable PSI for front/rear* LED Light* Air bleed knob* Bonus: It comes with a case.Cons:* The case could be sturdier so the LED light switch doesn\\'t accidentally get squeezed.It\\'s rare when I don\\'t post a real \"con\" for a review.', u\"I naturally assume there is always *something* that could be improved on or isn't working perfectly.\", u'In this instance, the only slight negative is the free cheap case.', u\"And that's not even really an issue for me.\", u':) But it sounds like Amazon really did their homework on this one.', u'I consider this highly recommended.']\n"

      "[u'To help quiet engine sound on the RV, installing it under the \"door\" to the engine, helped a little.', u'It wasn\\'t large enough to cover the whole \"door\".', u\"It does do as it's described, it reduces sound.\", u'It does not eliminate it.', u'This is a small piece of extremely heavy vinyl.', u'It is very sticky feeling, with a tacky surface, and the stickiness is transfered to your fingers as you handle it.', u'It is thin but feels like lead.', u'I suppose this is what it takes to deaden sound.', u\"It looks like it might melt into a mess in very high heat although I didn't test it for that.\", u'It is described on the box as a \"self adhesive, comformable mat that reduces road noise and vibration.The instructions say to:1.', u'Prepare area by removing any carpteing, lining and/or panels to expose metal substrate.2.', u'Clean the surface with rubbing alcohol and let dry.', u'Ensure surface is free of oil, dust and debris.3.', u'Using standard household scissors cut the 3M Sound Reduction Mat to fit the size of the desired area.4.', u'Peel and discard the yellow liner off the back of the mat.5.', u'Using even pressure, carefully conform and firmly apply to the surface.', u'If additional conformaity is needed, use a heat gun or blow dryer to heat the mat to 95 degrees to 115 degrees.The box suggests use in the trunk, door panel, or for speaker installations.', u'My first thought would be the engine compartment but as I said this is something that appears to me it would melt in high heat, and the directions to use a blow dryer to help this conform to curved surfaces supports that viewpoint.', u'With that in mind, I would be hesitant to use this here in our sub tropic weather where in the summer the interior of a car can climb to well over 120 degrees.', u\"I would be afraid of this melting into a mass of sticky goo.I've seen other sound reduction technologies in cars.\", u'They look more like a thick blanket, rather than heat sensitive vinyl.In addtion, the added weight of several of these in a car is worth considering.', u\"This is like lead as far as weight.In a cold climate this might be ok, but I am going to not use this in our sweltering weather due to the melting propensity of it.If your climate doesn't get extremely hot, this would be OK to place under a speaker or subwoofer installation, as it would help to deaden any vibrations.\", u'If you plan to soundproof your entire car or even just the engine compartment, you would need a lot of these.', u'This is a pretty small piece when you see it in person.', u'Installing sound reduction mats in your car is a great way to reduce road noise and vibrations.', u\"The matting absorbs the sounds and adds weight to a panel, reducing it's tendency to vibrate.\", u'Matting can be placed inside trucks, engine walls, inside doors - pretty much anywhere there is metal it can stick to.We have a 1984 Mustang that is a street legal drag car.', u'It has a loud exhaust, it is so loud that it sets off car alarms when driving by parked vehicles.', u'Everything in that car vibrates including my teeth.', u'The most annoying vibrations came from the trunk.', u'We cut long strips of the 3M Sound Reduction Mat and adhered it to the parts of the hatchback where they touched metal-to-metal.', u'The vibrations halted.', u'Now time to go to the next section of the Stang.', u'However, We are going to have to purchase more rolls since this roll is was only big enough to do a small job.I am pleased with the performance of this product, but it made me aware that there are many other brands that offer larger mats at better prices.', u'Besides mats, there are also sprays, foams, and insulation available from different manufacturers.', u'I thought this would be a quick and easy solution to muffling the rattles emanating from a 1998 ford.', u'I was wrong.', u'The product is a fairly hard black vinyl with an adhesive back.', u'Designed to be used on metal surfaces, it must be applied when temperatures are higher than 40 degrees farenheit.', u'The surface must be thoroughly cleaned.', u'The mat may be sized by cutting with scissors or in my case an exacto knife.The backer is removed and the mat is positioned.', u'Then ideally, the mat will fit securely and the offending noises muffled.', u'If necessary you may use a blow dryer or heat gun.Sounds great.', u\"But it isn't quite so easy.\", u'First, it being winter in NY, I had to wait until the temperatures rose.', u'I had planned to use this in a door.', u'But the material is inflexible, cuttable, but still inflexible.', u\"Worse, I couldn't get it to stick in position.\", u'So I wound up taking it off.', u'My brother then took the remainder for the back floor of his suv.', u'He had better luck getting it to stick using a heat gun.', u'He is satisfied with its noise muting capabilities.This product was not for me.', u'Unless you are adept at accessing the offending parts and fairly handy, this requires significantly more work than the package suggests.', u'When properly applied, it does seem to work.', u'I wonder if the adhesion is effected by heat as well as cold.', u'Obviously, the material becomes more brittle in the cold and does not adhere.', u'Conversely, in high summer heat, does it melt or become gooey?', u\"I dodn't know.\", u'I think the product can perform adequately but unless you are experienced with this type of installation, I would pass.', u\"This 3M sound reduction mat's appearance is best likened to gasket material according to my husband who has a great deal of experience with such things...just in case you wanted to have a better handle on what it looks like.The main limitation of this mat is its size.\", u'It is ideal for speaker use, but any larger application will require multiple sheets.', u'If we wanted to use this in our door panel, we would  probably prefer to buy a larger sheet or product and place it there in order to maximize the sound reduction through consistency and lack of gaps as well as to reduce the weight that several of these mats would ad.', u'We park along a curb or sidewalk nightly and already have to finagle opening our passenger door to get out of the car.', u'If it were just a bit more weighty with this material, it would be more difficult to keep it from scraping the concrete.', u'Anyone using this mat for a large surface area would need to consider such issues.However, for a speaker or speakers, this would be fine if you can find the temperature sweet spot that allows for an easier application.', u'It took a bit of doing for us to make this work, and if were doing a vertical stick, it probably would not have staid put at this point in time (early spring).', u\"What's in the box?\", u'* One sound-deadening sheet approximately 5/32\" thick.', u'You can use it as one mat, 19 11/16\" by 19 11/16\", or as two smaller mats (it has a perforation down the middle).', u'* Instructions.In general, I find 3M products to be of superior quality.', u'I do like this product, but have some reservations.', u'In regard to performance, it DOES work!', u'I used it for an application other than an automobile, which is also other than its intended purpose.I have a small work/storage room in my basement.', u\"It has slab floor, drywall, and is narrow, less than 5' wide.\", u\"I have a backup sump pump in the room, which has a control module which manages the backup pump's battery, etc.\", u'The module has always produced an electrical buzz/hum, which can be quite annoying when in the room.', u'The module is in the corner of the workroom on a small cabinet, so it is about 5\" from a wall on two sides of it.', u'The walls both have pegboard, and in the past I tried fixing some Styrofoam to board by the module.', u'This served only to slightly amplify the buzz.So I decided to try this product.', u'For my application, I mounted some 1/8\" thick wood that I had from a packing crate on the pegboard.', u'I did this, so I would not damage the pegboard with the 3M mats.', u'The mat gripped well, but like anything else of an adhesive nature, you want to measure right and work slowly, as adjusting it afterward is not really an option.', u'Once you have peeled the paper and applied it, it is on fairly well.', u'You could get it off, but would likely wreck it in the process.', u'As far as sizing it, cutting this is like cutting other dense, adhesive type materials.', u'A sharp blade with firm, steady strokes is best.', u'The blade will get a little gummy so plan on changing it out or cleaning it afterward.', u'TIP: If you rub a little WD-40 on sides of the blade, it helps it glide through a little more easily.For my purpose, I separated the mat into two halves at the perforation.', u'I needed to trim them slightly to fit my application.', u'I applied them so that the module had a mat behind it and on one side.', u\"I didn't think I'd have great results, especially with two sides still not dampened.\", u'However, the sound of the buzz was dramatically reduced.So, this stuff works, and it adheres well, etc.', u'Now the issue: there is not a lot of it to a box, and at over $15 a box, it can be pricy per square foot.', u'If you are using this to deaden sound in a whole car, or even a large area of a car, four doors, trunk, etc., I could see it get expensive very fast.It does work as advertised.', u'I think there needs to be a little more per box to warrant using it, unless you have a very specific application in a contained area (one door, one speaker area, etc.).', u'I installed this sound reduction mat in the trunk of my Mitsubishi Lancer Rally Edition.', u\"It' not the quietest of cars so I figured it could use a little soundproofing.\", u'Even though this roll looks somewhat big it was used up quite quickly.', u\"I didn't have enough to cover the entire truck but was able to do most of it.\", u'Installation was a breeze on My Lancer because all I had to do was reach under the truck liner and apply the adhesive mat.', u\"It stick's fine to a nice and clean surface.\", u'Just be sure to clean any area that is dirty or dusty prior to attempting to install the mat.', u\"I don't notice any sound difference when driving really but notice a little difference when riding in the back seat of the car.\", u'I think this product works a little but might not be for the average person because it would take so many rolls and so much work installing it.', u\"Especially if you are doing the inside of your door panels it's a lot of work with only a small payoff.\", u'However if you have a loud sound system or just an extremely loud car then it may be worth the work.', u\"Being that this only comes in one size that's a big downside.\", u'I hope to see 3M make other sizes available for bigger applications like most people  are doing.', u'I installed this in the trunk of my vehicle and did not notice a big difference in road noise reduction.', u'I think there are better alternatives.', u\"I've seen big mats and bigger rolls through other vendors online.\", u\"Overall, unless this is just for around speakers I don't think this will fit many applications unless you want to buy a lot, but if you are buying a lot there are some other semi and custom products to fit your exact need.\", u'I think that for a sound deadening material like this to work, you would need to install a lot of it if the goal is to make a noticeable difference in noise levels inside a car.', u\"Just adding it to exposed trunk panels which I thought might be the source of excessive road noise didn't seem to make any difference at all.\", u'Perhaps the real point is that reducing annoying sound levels requires expertise far beyond mine.', u\"I suppose that isn't the fault of the product, but it is a matter of expectations not being met.\", u'A professional who knows what they are doing would probably need a whole lot of this material installed in the right places to make a difference.', u'This product did block noise in the spot it was placed but the entire piece of material is 20x19.5 inches so will only be useful if your noisy spot is smaller that this.', u'One side has glue on it.', u\"This is a good idea for a product because most of us have car noises and vibrations we'd like to eliminate.\", u'However, I have a couple issues with this product.For one thing, the instructions are intimidating.', u\"After reading them (and re-reading them), I decided this would be best installed by someone who's done this kind of thing before.\", u\"I could do it, but I'd likely end up messing up and the frustration level seems high.\", u\"The examples illustrated on the package are not impressive, and I'm sure I would do much worse.Secondly, to do a thorough job it appears that you need more than one box of this mat.\", u'For example, to apply the mat to the trunk area requires 2 boxes (the estimated time is 30 minutes--I assume this is for a professional), and 1 box is required for each door (the estimated time is 15 minutes per door.', u')I might consider trying to use the mat for speaker installation because that requires less than one box.', u\"However, in looking at the illustration I'm again intimidated.This might be a great product if you've had experience with something like it before, but I'm going to leave this one to the professionals.\", u'I used this in the wheel well of my suv to try to deaden some road noise.', u'The mat was brittle and some of it broke into small pieces that I discarded.', u'The mat itself is small and it would take quite a few of them to make much difference in the amount of road noise infiltrating a car.', u'It would also be a tremendous amount of work and time to install on floor boards.', u'doors and wheel wells.', u\"The investment in time and money wouldn't be worth a little less noise.\", u'For me the time and effort to install this product is not worth the benefits, if any.', u'A trunk installation requires two mats, but I tried it with the one I had.', u\"If you don't mind sizing and installing contact paper, then you may not mind installing this sound deadening mat.\", u\"There seems to be some reduction in sound from the trunk, and most likely a second mat would have produced better results.The 3M mats would probably work best for smaller applications, like around speakers, and for those who like little projects and don't mind expending some time and effort to install the mat.\", u'These sound proofing mats are extremely stiff.', u\"I wanted to use them in my vehicle's tailgate.\", u'I took the precaution of taking a hair dryer out to warm them up so they would fit securely since the flooring has some very wide grooves.', u'Even with that these would not conform to the flooring, they lay on top.It would take several more purchases in order to cover the whole area; there are numerous other products out there that seem more reasonable in cost.', u'With this partial coverage there is no difference in the sound level and I have no confidence that these will stay on with the constant loading and unloading of items, since they refuse to stick to the whole flooring, but just the tops of the wide  grooved surface - wish they would state that surface must be completely flat.', u\"It does show the mat bending to the curve and bumps of a door in their directions - sure didn't work for me.\"]\n"

the towel, I found that any dirt/grease marks were very difficult to get out.\", u'Admittedly, this is user error.', u'However, often, in the final stages of washing, it is tempting to wipe over those last few spots you missed, while washing, and hit them with the drying towel after having dried the car from top to bottom (especially those missed areas at the bottom).I ran the towel through the washing machine twice, with lots of soap, high heat, high agitation, and the dirt/grease marks were hardly removed at all.', u'I love the towel, it works perfectly.', u'However, I will need to find a

really worth it?', u'The answer is a big YES!!!!!!!!!', u\"!1st off I run water from hose after removing sprayer as my final rinse so it sheets most of the water beads into a big puddle and off the

drying.', u'Leaves streak free.', u'Easy to wring out.', u'Great product.', u'Used it to dry a machine washed car.', u'Soaked up water easily and quickly.', u'Soft and easy to grab while using.', u'LOVE THIS!', u'Dries my entire car without having to ring it out once.', u\"I don't know how I dried my car before I bought this.\", u'Highly recommended.', u\"I bought a competing company's expensive MF drying towel and it was way too big and didn't seem to hold as much water as this.\", u'This towel is the perfect size, big enough to hold lots of water but small enough to not drag on the ground and for you to wring it out easily.', u'Highly recommended.', u'This Meguiars drying towel does a great job at soaking up the water only have to ring it out once on bigger vehicles but on smaller vehicles never have to ring it out.', u'Very reasonably priced for its quality, and it does the job really well, dries very effectively and easily, I am stacking up on those for my cars.', u'exactly works as stated.', u'though i use it only in winter months.', u'in texas summers you would not need it.', u':) It is a good towel for the price and works good for drying.', u'I would have liked it to be a little larger though for the purpose of soaking up more water when drying my car.', u'Overall: Recommend this product.', u'I find that this towel is great for the purpose intended.', u'However, the towel purchased is beginning to fall apart on one end.', u\"I'm not sure what they make this with, but this towel works great and is very soft to the touch.\", u\"I'm buying for my other cars.\", u\"We've always been a fan of Meguiar's products & this is just as impressive.\", u'These were to replace several drying towels that were well past their prime & much smaller.', u'I believe that size does matter...when it comes to being able to dry much larger areas with less effort.', u'The waffle design seems to dry much quicker that the flat towels.', u\"Though I am a big fan of Meguiar's, I didn't have much hope for this being any better than any other towel, but I am happy to say that it really works great.\", u'I am a bit nuts about taking care of my car, and I have added these towels to my giant bucket of car care supplies.', u\"After doing a standard two bucket wash with Meguiar's soap and microfiber wash mitt, my first step is to go over the whole car with an electric leaf blower.\", u'I keep my car waxed, so the water beads well, and the blower takes care of 90% of the drying work.', u'I quickly follow up with the Water Magnet Drying Towel to get the few bits that the blower leaves.', u'This minimizes the amount of rubbing I have to do, which (at least in my opinion) helps to prolong the life of the wax job.', u'With this towel, one light pass over the wet spots is all it takes, and it leave a streak-free dry car.', u'Since most of the water is gone after blowing it off, I never get close to saturating the towel, but I can tell from how much of the towel I do use that it will hold quite a bit.', u'Even the part of the towel that has become damp is still drying in one pass.', u'I can\\'t speak for the $25+ towels, but I couldn\\'t ask for a \"car towel\" to do any more than this towel does at only a few dollars.', u'Remember not to bleach it, and not to use any kind of fabric softener, and it will be good as new right out of the dryer.', u'This towel is totally amazing.', u'Once again Meguires has made another superior car care product.', u'It drys a car faster than any other product on the market (way better than a real or imitation chamois, terry cloth, cotton, or microfiber towel ever could).', u\"It's easy to clean and to take care of; it's worth every penny.\", u'Great towel, it makes the job, great absorption, easy to wring.', u'I decide to whas them by hand because I want to use them for long time :) This is by far the best drying towel that I have used thus far.', u'Way better than that lousy chamois king.', u'The towel is not huge, but it works like a bigger towel.', u'Holds a lot of water, rings out well.', u\"I use it on my SUV's, wash and dry one, by the time I wash the other SUV it is ready to dry again.I recommend using a waffled towel for drying your vehicle, and Meguiar's will not disappoint!\", u'Best basic waffle towel available hands down.', u'Still very soft after numerous car washes and cleanings.', u'Also works great as a drying towel for housework.']\n"

ERROR'.\", u'I have always wanted one of these but always thought they cost hundreds of dollars.', u'As a woman I know that I am a target for any dishonest repair shop, and not knowing I am familiar with car mechanics they sometimes lie to me about what my car needs.So for that reason alone, I was delighted to get this small but powerful tool.', u'Now before I take my car in for maintenance I can scan its codes quickly and be prepared for the inevitable news that I need a lot more repairs on my car.', u\"I can smile and drive off and leave them looking confused and puzzled when I don't take the bait.\", u\"Not to slam all repair shops but I have run into some heavy duty attempts at conning me into paying for repairs my car doesn't need.I carry this with me in my car, especially on car trips, for those scary times when I'm on the road and the check-engine light comes on.\", u\"I also keep the manual in my car so I can diagnose the code by the side of the road and decide if it's safe to keep driving.This just plugs in, and you push the button and read the codes, or lack of them.\", u\"It's simple and fast to use.\", u'When I used to buy and sell used cars I could have used this.', u'The repair manual is complete with hundreds of codes and descriptions for whatever readout you get.', u'You will need to write down your code when you get it, and compare it with the manual to see what it is indicating.I love how this will also check the emissions control system, and the air conditioning system.On my 2012 Accura the plug is right there under and to the left of the steering wheel.', u\"It's not even in the dash or in a compartment, so it's simple to find it and plug this in.\", u'You plug this in while the key is turned so the dash lights come on but the car is not running, to activate the cars electrical system.', u'This requires no batteries.To test how accurate this is, I dislodged the gas cap and tested my car with this.', u'Sure enough it gave me the code for a problem with the gas line.', u'I can promise you this works and is accurate based on my test of it.How they can sell this small computer at this price I have no idea, and the 40 page manual that comes with it is amazing, giving you hundreds of codes and which parts need replacing.', u'I am thinking the price must be wrong here.I have taken back control and empowered myself when I go to a car repair shop with this.', u\"It's my new secret weapon and I love it.I was supplied with a free sample which did not affect my review.\", u'This is a great product at an amazing price.', u'Our car computers hold SO much information but the message we, as consumers, receive is a little yellow engine light that frankly incites so much fear that, when I see it, I want to pull over and dial 911 before my car bursts into flames.', u\"Sure, I've been told that sometimes it is nothing more than reaching a magic number on the odometer or any number of tiny other things, but that engine light is still so vague and yet so terrifying...and that's what the dealership wants.\", u'Terror.', u'I called the dealership about my engine light and a &#34;diagnostic reading&#34; was $150 then they could tell me what needed to be done.', u'So that engine light, that may have popped on for nothing more than me crossing some imaginary mile, could cost me $150 for nothing more than to have them to turn it off.', u'And God forbid you just leave it on...try selling a car with the engine light on.', u'Tell your buyer &#34;it is just the mileage indicator&#34;.This plugs right into your car under the dash on the drivers side.', u'A meaningless fault code will appear on the little screen.', u\"And even if you don't have the fault code guide book right with you, you can type that exact code into Google.\", u'Well, any time i have ever done it anyway, it gave me the meaning and diagnosis of the engine light.', u'This also gives you the option of turning the d--- thing off.', u\"So if it is a &#34;just wanted to let you know you've driven 50k miles&#34; light, you don't have to drop a couple of bills getting the dealer to explain that.I've used one of these for years when I've had less-than-new cars.\", u'This one was sent to me for test and review.', u\"Currently I don't have any check engine lights or problems.\", u'I plugged it in anyway and it appears to work fine.', u\"I am at 41000 miles, so if I get that idiot light at 50k and this product doesn't work, I will update.\", u\"But DEFINITELY invest in one of these if you have a car that isn't under a full bumper to bumper warranty in your family.\", u'It will save you far more than it costs.', u\"I'm a big fan.\", u'Quite by coincidence, the manufacturer of this device offered me a sample about a week after my CEL came on.', u\"The following is my honest opinion.So many of us have been there - you're driving along quite happily and suddenly your dashboard gets a little brighter.\", u'As you notice exactly WHICH light came on, it suddenly becomes a burning stare of gloom, an automotive Medusa.', u\"Okay, I'm being dramatic, but it seriously makes for a crappy day.\", u\"A week later, this little guy came in the mail, and following the relatively well-written and simple instructions, I plugged it in and started reading.Turns out my code isn't the end of the world - something to do with one of my fuel system gaskets that is either going to be an $80 or $120 part.\", u\"But still, unless you have your code read (I know autozone does this for free but I don't have one near me) by a mechanic, you're driving blind, so to speak.\", u'Another nifty feature is the code reset.', u'Just for kicks, I reset my codes and hey presto - off goes the CEL.', u\"Of course about 50 miles later it was tripped again (if only resetting codes would magically fix the problem) but it's nice to know it works.\", u\"You can also read your VIN number which is handy, especially if you're buying a used car and want to make sure everything matches up!Overall, this is definitely worth the modest price.\", u\"It works very well, has a small profile (I keep it in the glove box) and the cable is long enough to be used while sitting in the driver's seat.\", u'Definitely recommended without reservation.', u'With my former car, I got complacent with the dealer repairs and paid dearly.', u'The fee for diagnostics at a dealer is high - up to $200, which of course can be negotiated down but what a hassle.', u\"Worse, much worse is that the role of diagnostics and that of repair if vested in the same party can lead to abuse.Put another way, those that deal with customer service and don't even see which mechanic works on the car are gamblers in a losing game.\", u'You can get away with it sometimes but it will catch up with you.', u'For that reason, people need their own diagnostic tool that can read error codes.', u'The book that comes with this diagnostic tool tells what the error codes mean.This device is great.', u\"No battery needed - it uses the car's electrical system (without the motor running).\", u'It plugged into my car with no problem.', u'Sample was provided.', u'This diagnostic fault code scanner tool has proven to be a very valuable tool so far.', u'This scanner connects to the 16 pin connector that is in most newer vehicles.', u'To tell if your vehicle is OBD II compliant and able to be read with this scanner tool then you will either need to locate the 16 pin data link connector if you are familiar with what it looks like or you can check the car or trucks emission control information label.', u'Most of the time the data link connector can easily be found under the dash and it very simple to access.', u\"I had no problem locating the connector on my 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer OZ Rally Edition.Our check engine light has been on for years and the dealer has told us that it's nothing to worry about and that it's just something to do with the catalytic converter.\", u'They have turned it off several times but it always comes back on.', u'I always wanted one of these scanner tools so I can read the error codes on my own but they were always more money than I was prepared to spend for one.', u\"At it's current price this scanner is extremely affordable and I am pretty sure it cost less than any others I have seen so far.This tool seems well made and very durable.\", u'The scanner is in a hard plastic case that can take a lot of abuse.', u\"The cable is thick and strong as well and about 3 feet long so it's plenty long enough to connect and sit in the car with it in your hands while you use it.\", u'The 16 pin connector on the end fits perfectly into the data link connector in my car.', u\"It doesn't have any batteries to replace and the LCD screen is back-lit and powered by your car or truck.\", u\"The screen is bright green and very clear and easy to read.The manual is lengthy but it's very clear and easy to read as well.\", u'It contains all of of the definitions that you will need to interpret your fault codes.', u\"I did a quick scan of the manual but I could have figured it out without the manual because it's so simple to operate.\", u\"Simply plug it in and turn your ignition switch to on but don't actually start your car.\", u\"It will take a minute or two to initialize and read your car's computer.\", u\"Once it's complete you can go into option 1 and get a list of every fault code that has been recorded.\", u'Once you have your codes you can look them up in the manual and find out what the problem is.', u\"This function works perfectly.If you go into option 2 then you can delete all of the fault codes that are recorded in your car's computer.\", u'I love option because I always had to disconnect the battery for a few minutes in order to clear the computer.', u\"You really can't do no harm by deleting the codes because if there is still a problem then they will be recorded again and your service engine soon light will illuminate after several trips in your car.\", u'This option works perfectly as well.Option 3 will perform a systems diagnostic and test the operations of the emissions control system.', u'This might be important if you are trying to get your car to pass a emissions test.Option 4 will provide the VIN number if your car or truck is compatible with this function.', u\"My car isn't compatible with this option so I am unable to test it.Overall I think this tool is awesome and anyone who works on cars or trucks will appreciate it.\", u'It was a welcome addition to my toolbox and one of the most useful tools in my garage.Sample provided for review.', u'The DB Power Autel OBD-2 code reader is a small solid basic code reader.', u'The device can read codes, save a snapshot of the codes, and reset the codes - all pretty standard features of a code reader.', u'The control package is rugged, the buttons and LCD have a membrane cover.', u'This is for the backyard mechanic that will do occasional reads, it is not a commercial reader, one that an auto mechanic would use every day.', u'All that said, this is still a solid device with heavy insulation on the wire and good strain relief.', u\"For the price, this is extremely well built.The cable is just over two feet long - exactly the right length to plug in the analyzer and sit in the driver's seat.\", u'The LCD is backlit with reasonably sized characters.', u'The two buttons have a solid distinct sound when they are pressed.The instruction manual is excellent.', u\"There is a long preface about OBD, the abbreviations used, and the caveats for which era of cars will work with the analyzer (the simple answer, if your car is newer than 1988, you can probably read the codes.Using this device couldn't be easier - turn off the car, plug in the connector, turn on the ignition (without starting the car - the battery light will be lit up on the dashboard), press enter on the scanner.\", u'There is nothing more to do.', u'When finished, turn off the ignition and unplug the scanner.', u\"There's no reason to overcomplicate using this.The OBD connector is easy to find in most newer cars - the Federal government requires the plug be within a short distance of the steering column.\", u'Unlike most things in a car, these connectors are in a similar location.', u'You might want a flashlight to find the plug.', u'Sometimes the sockets are covered by a flip down panel.This tool only reads stored codes.', u'It does not do real time reading.', u'It does not read additional data like some of the USB / wireless readers.I tried this on a variety of cars and managed to reset a code on one car.', u'Bottom line - the thing flat out works.', u'I fully expected it to work easily on a 2002 Buick Rendezvous and a 2012 Ford Focus (I was able to read the VIN on both of these cars).', u\"I expected the Mercedes to not work at all - I have read that there are odd things about Mercedes that doesn't fit standard.\", u'Well in fact it worked perfectly on a 1999 Mercedes E320.', u'Vin number for Mercedes is not supported.', u'There are numerous cautions in the manual about certain compatibility issues with Japanese and European cars - that is for very old cars.', u'Current production cars will have no problems with this analyzer.', u'If your car does not scan - more than likely you had the ignition on before plugging in the meter, or you have the engine running.', u'I did not expect the analyzer to work on a Ford Focus Electric (this is a full battery electric, NOT a hybrid) - it in fact did not work, there is nothing to read on that car, it is zero emissions.', u'The operative thing, with the electric, the tool went through every protocol and then showed an input error and stopped scanning.', u'Exactly as I expected.Resetting codes was super easy.', u'There is a menu setting to erase codes, after pressing enter, there is a Yes / No display.', u'If you press Enter again, all codes are reset.', u'If you press Scroll, the codes are not erased.', u'I like the &#34;are you sure&#34; moment on the display.', u'Yes / No is a weird thing to display - there is no button to press for No.', u'After codes are reset, it will look like nothing happened.', u'I rescanned, and the code remained.', u'In order to see the actual reset or clear in of the code, you need to turn off the car and turn the ignition back on.The manual has a huge list of error codes.', u'I was surprised to find the exact code from a Mercedes.', u\"I didn't expect to find that code in the book.This is a reasonably priced reader.\", u'For a backyard mechanic that knows which end of a wrench to use, this is a great tool.', u'For the average person, this is probably a needless purchase - unless you understand cars pretty well it is difficult to do anything about those codes.', u'For example - what would you do about a P0938 - Hydraulic Oil Temp Sensor CKT Range/Performance - code?', u'Most of the codes are that cryptic to the average person.', u'The only way the average person saves money with this is if they try to bypass set codes to pass an emission test (if your state requires OBD scan emission tests).', u\"If you are really going to repair a Check Engine light, a mechanic already has more sophisticated tools to read the computer, and that will be part of the cost of the repair (he isn't going to reduce the cost of the repair because you tell him the code is P0938, and he might want to check the hydraulic oil system).\", u\"Following the directions in the accompanying manual, I was able to use this device to scan the codes in my car's computer and read my vehicle's VIN.\", u\"Although the nearby Pep Boys shop will run a FREE scan for me, having a scanner of my own is much more convenient and I can see the results myself without having them &#34;interpreted&#34; by the mechanic.The dealer where I bought my car new won't hook up a scanner for less than $100.\", u'This little gadget will certainly save me some bucks because I can identify the problem myself and have a good idea of what kind of repairs may be necessary before I take my car to the shop.', u'If you have detected a problem and have fixed it yourself, you can reset the code that causes your engine light to come on.', u'Not only does it scan the codes on my car, it also scans the codes on my Winnebago Itasca Sunova Model 33C motorhome.', u'This scanner will be accompanying me during my travels in my coach to help us sniff out any troubles that come up.For anybody who wants to know what is going on with his or her car or other compatible vehicle, this scan tool is a reasonably-priced way to become informed.I was provided a free sample of this device in exchange for an honest review, which you have just read.', u'Anyone who has driven a car for years has had that panicked feeling when the \"check engine\" light came on.', u'Is the car going to burst into flames?', u'Am I permanently damaging the engine by continuing to drive?', u\"Should I pull over and call AAA or just limp home?I've been in that position several times, and then I had to blindly trust the repair guy at the shop when he brought me me the estimate with dollar signs in his eyes.\", u'They charge me $80 for using a diagnostic machine like this one, plus parts and labor for whatever they say is causing the problem.', u\"Even with a shop I mostly trust, I always feel like they push for repairs I don't really need.\", u\"I don't like feeling taken advantage of, or having to trust that I really need a new widget for $800.\", u'This fault code reader will save me lots of money by letting ME decide whether the repair needs to be done now or later.This meter works on cars built after 1996, most of which are OBD-II compliant (they use the same type of plug for the meters, and the coding system for errors).', u\"It plugs into an outlet that's found under the dash on the driver's side in most vehicles.\", u'Mine was hanging right there in plain view when I looked under the dash.', u'You plug the meter in, then turn the ignition to \"on\" but don\\'t start it.', u'The meter will do the diagnostic and then give you whatever codes it finds.', u\"You can look in the meter's user's manual or online to see what the codes mean.\", u\"It's really that simple.On the meter's package, I read something I wouldn't have thought of myself.\", u\"If you're thinking of buying a used car, you can use this meter to check the soundness of the engine.\", u\"It will show you any hidden engine issues via the stored codes in the car's computer.\", u\"Brilliant!I don't have an error code to diagnose right now, but I did plug the meter in on my car so I'd be able to write a knowledgeable review.\", u'I will love going to the repair shop next time and being able to tell THEM what the error code is.', u\"If I know the code has nothing to do with an $800 widget, I won't be taken advantage of.I received a complimentary DB Power Engine Diagnostic Fault Code Reader for testing and review purposes.\", u'First off I want to say that theDB POWER Car Engine Diagnostic Fault Code Reader Scan Scanner Tool OBD2 OBD II MS300worked perfectly in our 2009 Malibu.', u'It  works on OBD-II compliant cars built after 1996 (most of them are OBD-II compliant)  & will retrieve the VIN (Vehicle Identification No) on 2002 and newer vehicles that support Mode 9.', u'When we try it in our 2004 Toyota Sienna & 2006 Civic, I will update my review with the results.One great idea on the packaging suggests you use this to identify any problems with a used car before you buy it.My husband & I were surprised how easy to use this Code Scanner is.', u'The hardest part was getting under the dash to look for the data link connector (DLC).', u'Trying to save my hubby a sore back, I suggested he  do an Internet search to find the DLC location for our Malibu.', u'He decided to look for it first & found it quickly under the dash & centered under the steering wheel.', u'Following the easy-to-understand manual, he hooked it up & continued to follow the step by step instructions.', u\"We didn't expect to find anything wrong with our Malibu...and when the scanner's LCD screen didn't show any diagnostic trouble codes (DTC) we knew we were correct.\", u'To make sure the scanner was actually working, I decided to check for the VIN number.', u\"The VIN number showed up on the screen, so I'd say this code scanner works as promised.I've been told that some car part shops will hook up a scanner for free, but it's nice to have your own.\", u\"If you're on the road & your car breaks down, this scanner could save you from being ripped off.\", u\"Also, if you plan on buying a used car, hook this code scanner up to it to check the car for any problems before you buy it.I'll update my review & let you know if it works on  our 2004 Toyota Sienna & our 2006 Honda Civic.No batteries needed.Limited One Year WarrantyUPDATE: 2004 Toyota Sienna...the DLC (it's white)  is located under the dash, slightly to the left of  the steering wheel.\", u'This code scanner worked for our Sienna (no problems were found); however the VIN is not supported.review sample provided The Autel MaxiScan OBDII scan tool requires no batteries and is easy to use.', u'First - read the user manual as it is very good.', u\"After that, refer to your car's manual to find the location of your car's OBDII port (if you do not know where it is), plug the scanner in, then follow the user manual to use the scanner.\", u\"This is a good scanner for cars built from 1996 on as cars since then have been required to have an OBDII port.If you lose your manual, one is available for download from various websites (just search for 'Autel MS300 manual') though the link on Autel's website seems to be broken at the moment.\", u\"Still, a complete pdf copy of the manual was available in several other places.Before I plug the scanner into my car's port, I turn the car on to make sure that all accessories are turned off (radio, a/c, heater, fan, GPS, etc...) and then I turn the car back off.\", u'This ensures that there is no unexpected power variance from accessory use while the scanner does its thing.', u\"Then, with the engine OFF but your key in the ignition switch:* Plug in the scanner's OBDII cable into your car's OBDII port* Turn the ignition key only to engage the electrical system; do not turn to engage the car's starter* Press the Enter button (blue button on the left) and the unit will begin its scan* Once scanned, press the Scroll button (blue button on right) to see if the scan found any issues* If codes exist, the manual has a very detailed list of scan codes and description for you to reference* Turn the ignition key back to the off position, remove your key and remove the scanner's cable from your car's OBDII portThis scanner does not require any batteries to operate as it works from the power supplied by your car's battery via the OBDII port connection.\", u\"It communicates with your car's central processing hub which collects information from the electronic control units of the major systems within your car (that is what the 'CAN Protocol' reference is about).\", u\"However, to use it and to read results from it, the unit needs to be plugged into the OBDII port in your car... so you should keep some paper and pencil handy when using it.Our local dealership charges $80 just to plug their scanner into our car's OBDII and perform this diagnostic, so this Autel MaxiScan will save me that much each time that I need to use it.\", u\"Additionally, I found the readout's black lettering to be easy to read against the backlit background,The last page of the users manual notes that this Autel MaxiScan device has a one year limited warranty, and that all warranty issues are handled directly with Autel through their website.\", u'If an issue arises before that period expires I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled.', u'We did receive this product gratis from the seller and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed.', u'My statements here reflect that testing.If you are looking for an OBDII scanner of this style and size, for use as I have described above, then I recommend this one highly based on its ease-of-use and excellent user manual.Go for it.', u\"I love that this scanner requires no batteries - it works off your car's power.\", u\"It's cheap and a good thing to have on hand should your check engine light come on.\", u'I know AutoZone will test your car at no charge, but the check engine light has to be \"on\" for them to do so.', u\"Some mechanics will charge you $79 on up to check your codes.This is easy to use once you find your car's diagnostic port (usually under or near the steering wheel under the dashboard).\", u\"I think the manual that comes with this leaves a little to be desired, I found more info on how to use this by watching the Autel YouTube videos.It doesn't work on all cars - and I don't know why it doesn't.\", u'It appears to me that cars built in Japan have less success with this.', u'I tried more than once and got a LINK ERROR for my 2010 Toyota Yaris.', u\"I never got it to work with my car--I've had no CEL warnings though.\", u\"I also tried it on a friend's 1996 Chevy Lumina that has had several CEL warnings recently, it gave me the code numbers to look up, cleared the codes, and a few days later the CEL came on again...so it clears the codes, but not permanently.\", u'~~~~ sample received for evaluation ~~~~']\n"

      "[u\"I've had a pair of Rain-X Latitude wipers on my Lexus RX300 for two months.\", u'I thought they were great and did a good job clearing the windshield until today.', u'Today, we had our first snow and sleet of the season in Philadelphia.', u\"As I drove to the grocery store, the driver's side wiper failed catastrophically.\", u'The entire blade assembly, with the exception of the mounting clip that fits into the car\\'s metal \"J\" arm (i.e., the wiper arm), fell off the car as I was driving, immediately costing me visibility in the sleet.', u'If you look at the picture of the wiper, the black plastic part in the middle essentially broke off of the blade assembly.', u'There was not much slush built up on the windshield at the time -- only a bit that the blade had pushed up and to the left side of the windshield while I drove.', u\"It wasn't as though I was trying to use the wipers on packed ice or anything.\", u\"Given the premium price of the blades, I was surprised at how weak the construction was.It should go without saying that a product failure of this nature is unacceptable given how important visibility is when driving at speed in inclement weather.I've been working on cars for more than twenty years.\", u'I know how to install blades.', u'I properly installed these wipers according to the included Rain-X directions.', u'After the blade fell off the car, the \"connector\" was still properly mounted to the car\\'s wiper arm; however, the product failure was that the Rain-X connector failed to hold the blade.', u'Because I still have the connector, I took a close look at it.', u\"It's only some plastic and, upon inspection, does not seem like a very robust design.\", u\"These wipers weren't properly designed and/or manufactured to withstand real world conditions.\", u\"I see other reviewers below have had similar bad experiences.I'll be sticking with Bosch, etc., in the future.\", u'Buy at your own risk.', u'After only a few days, my 26\" wiper developed a large area that it would not wipe, so I had to buy a new wiper.', u'Since it may be due to getting a \"bad one\" and since the smaller wiper seems to work better, I\\'ll give it two stars instead of just one.', u'My Nissan Quest required a 28\" and an 18\".', u'It wasn\\'t until after I had them on for a while that I noticed the 28\" does not cleanly touch the glass surface in the center of the spread, the point where the blade attaches to the wiper arm.', u'This leaves a wet 2\" channel arc right in my line of sight.', u'I thoroughly examined the blade and the attachment, making sure it was attached as intended.', u'It was.', u'My guess is that the pressure that keeps the outer edges of the blade firmly on the glass is so strong it lifts the center up.', u'The 18\" appears to be ok.', u'I wish I still had the box to send it back.', u'Now I need another new blade.', u'Than Advance Auto Parts.', u'At the time I am writing this, they are $14 on Amazon for the 16 inch blades.', u'I just paid $18 at Advance.', u'I know better than to not check Amazon first.', u':(.', u\"I have three of these on my windshield as I have a 2012 FJ Cruiser.I've had them about a week.\", u\"There are a couple of spots at the top of two of the blades that don't make contact with the windshield.\", u'I\\'m annoyed because  Advance Auto had them billed as \"The Best\"  I could have done as well I think with the cheap $5 blades.', u'I will update after having these a few months here in Tropical Storm Florida.', u'Maybe they need to stretch out on my windshield for a few days.', u'The part that does make contact does a nice job.', u'And one of the blades is perfect.', u'these are the worst wiper blades I have ever used.', u'they leave streaks on the windshield and do a horrible job in the rain.', u'I tried to contact the seller to ask them for an exchange only to be told that my return date expired.', u'If there were negative stars I would use them for this product..', u'Even cheap wiper blades do a better job than these blades.', u'I have a 2005 BMW 330xi.', u'These are some of the few wiper blades that have the correct (very large) adapter for my model BMW.', u'I only know if this wiper blade and ICON for having the correct fit.These squeak, streak, and are just a pain.', u'There are times where the smallest bit of water is on my windshield, and it just spreads the water around more and it become more of an issue.Maybe it is just the pair I got, but for the price of these I fully expect them to work flawlessly.', u'But sadly, these are absolutely horrid.I have heard good things about Bosch ICON, so I will be giving those a try here soon.', u'These wiper blades leaves a smear on the driver side 2005 Ford F-150 that is outright dangerous if driving at night.', u'I discovered the problem during a 2,200 road trip through Colorado in January.', u'Not being able to see at night is no fun.', u\"Having to stop at gas station to do the wiper's job is silly.\", u'These wipers are expensive but their performance is unacceptable.', u\"I've had my eye on these wiper blades for a while, because I had heard some pretty good things.\", u'Once a sale hit, I was all over them.The very first thing I noticed when I replaced the OEM blades on my 2013 Charger was how massive the brackets are.', u\"I didn't have any delusions about a universal-fit part looking like a contiguous part of my wiper arm, but seriously, the bracket on this is just huge.I appreciated how well-constructed the rest of the blade seemed to be, and that in spite of the gigantic bracket, the blade didn't wobble.\", u'Then I tried them out.', u'Ugh.', u'They streak like no other.', u\"I've actually treated my windshield withRain-X 800002243 Glass Treatmentand I use Rain-X washer fluid religiously, so if there's a windshield in town that should be slicker than a... well... you know... it's mine.\", u'Yet, these blades do a horrendous job of keeping my windshield clear.After a couple of weeks, I ended up putting the OEM blades back on.', u'Those year-old blades performed far better than these new ones.', u\"I really thought these blades would be awesome replacements for my OEM's, I was wrong.\", u'They do not form to the window and they leave streaks right in the eye line of the windshield.', u\"I'm definitely going to replace them soon, but will not be buying Rain X ever again.\", u\"SO FAR I HAVE FOUND THESE WINDSHIELD WIPERS TO WEAR OUT QUICKLY AND STREAK LEAVING LINES WHERE THE RUBBER IS CRACKED AND THEY AREN'T OVER SIX WEEKS OLD.\", u'THEY RECEIVE GOOD RATINGS SO ILL CHALK THESE FIRST PAIRS UP TO A BAD LOT.', u'I purchased this 24 inch wiper blade, thinking it was a quality product.', u'After one month I got one streak, by six months the whole contact area was streaking.', u'I purchased the Good Year Assurance at Costco, buy one get one free for $7.99 and after six months on my other car they still work like new.The 18 inch Rainex I purchased still worked fine after six months, but being paired up with a loser I changed them both.Goodyear GY-WB765-24 Assurance Black Premium Rubber Graphite Coated Wiper Blade, 24\" (Pack of 1)I had the Latitude on my other car in 24 and 18 inch and after a few months they began to squeak.', u'It is amazing how much you pay and how little you get.Rainex works very well, but their wiper blades and window cleaner are not worth buying, just goes to show what happens when a company expands the product line and forgets the quality.', u'squeep-squeep-thunk.thunk-snack, thunk-snack.knock-whack, knock-whackkveetch-chit-chit-crunk-snitBut why belabor the point.', u'Worked well for about six months, then started smearing a little, and the noises got more interesting over time.', u'And intolerable.Back to Bosch for me.', u'These work for about a week and then cease to function the way they first did.', u'I would not recommend them for a Jeep vehicle.', u'I would search for a different brand.']\n"

driving distance illuminate with luxury and brilliance.', u'Since I go off-roading, its great to have high beams as well, tough the left halogen bulb has seem to have burned out; might be contacting Kensun about this, but overall, these lights rock!!!', u'Ok so I ordered this on Friday and got it on Monday as I have Prime.', u\"This was expected and I'm glad I got it so fast.\", u\"But I wasn't to sure about the packaging.\", u'The bubble packaging had all popped and there was really nothing in the box to keep the Kensun kit from bouncing around inside.Well I opened the package and was inspecting everything when oh and behold a wire falls out of the hid bulb.', u'Literally fell right off!', u\"So I've called the customer service because I've heard good things about them and their service.\", u'They were kind enough to listen to the problem and said they would send out a replacement bulb which would get here by the end of the week.', u\"So as far as this product goes so far I'm giving it 3 stars until I get the replacement bulb.\", u\"I'll be testing out the good one today and see how it turns out.\", u\"Aside from that I do admit the customer service was good and the rest of the product looks in good condition...so far.Update:  3 weeks later.So I've loved the new look of my fog lights.\", u'These are amazing at night and the color is just right.', u\"I have to say that they were a little interesting to plug in and other than the issue I wrote about above I haven't had more.\", u'Kensun has been kind enough to help me replace the defects on the product and seem actually interested in the quality of their product to me.', u\"So far I'm happy with the product now and the customer service they offer.\", u\"Therefore I've upgraded my stars to 4 for these guys.\", u'I most likely purchase from here again.', u\"this is a great buy for what you get,the bulbs and ballasts,and they have lasted a good while to,for what you get they are a great buy I've installed HIDs three times total in my car, and out of all of the bulbs, these were the most difficult.Before I begin on that, let me start off with the brightness.I ordered the 5000k (&#34;Diamond White&#34;), for maximum brightness, for my 2012 Impreza.\", u'Originally had Xentec HIDs, which one ended up failing.The light output of this bulb is far superior to that of the Xentec, likely 3 times as bright.', u\"Though I don't have a projector housing, and the light isn't exactly concentrated as if I did have the correct housing, they look fantastic.As far as installing them, my headlight ended up coming damaged.\", u'The plastic clip which turns to lock into the headlight housing was somehow chipped (as if the package was opened before).', u\"I had to almost force-turn it into the housing for it to stay, but it's secure at the moment.\", u\"The package did in fact look to be opened and carelessly re-closed, as if they were returned, but at the moment i'm not worried.Overall, for the money (which I didn't really know whether it would have been worth it before purchasing), these headlights are ten times as good as the Xentec pair I had bought twice before, and the stock halogen lights my Impreza had when bought.\", u'Unlike most people who purchase these types of kits, I was not as concerned about the &#34;look&#34; of HID headlights on my 2011 RAM.', u'I was more interested in the brighter, more visible light and the low current draw associated with HID technology.', u'I ordered this kit hoping it would be of good components and well contructed, and it appears to be just that.', u\"I've tested the current draw after the ballasts charge and the lights are stabilized and they are drawwing a steady 16.3 watts, which is primarily what I was after.\", u'The bulbs throw a very bright, well-defined pattern that is cutoff on top by my stock reflector housings.', u'I have them aimed just a little lower than the stock setting as to not blind oncoming traffic and I have not been flashed once.', u'I did very quickly order 5000K bulbs to replace the 4300K bulbs that I originally ordered with the kit because I wanted slightly more white spectrum light, rather than the yellowish light that the originals threw.', u\"I was headed over the mountains and wanted to try these out because visibility around here isn't that great.\", u'Me and a co worker put them in my Silverado at break time.', u\"I turn them on after install and they didn't come on so from reading the reviews I knew that I had to turn the main power connection from the original 9006 bulb around.\", u\"then they worked like a charm, I drove all night and didn't have a problem.\", u\"I stayed with the 6000 K because I didn't want to stand out too bad but they do have a hint of blue so the police can tell but it's not offensive they will probably leave me alone.\", u'My only complaint is I wish there was a clasp for the main power to the ballast on the opposite side since had to flip it around.', u\"I also had one of the clasps on the ballast that connects to the headlight wire that wasn't there.\", u\"I had already got a email from the company to see if there's anything I needed and I expect to hear back from them after my reply tomorrow since they are closed right now.\", u'I will tell you this though, your headlights will seem really yellow in comparison These fit in nice and easy on my 2006 subaru impreza.', u'If you are having difficulty trying to find the HID/LED you are looking for; there are numerous websites with diagrams on bulb to LED/HID size conversion.', u'Installed in under one hour, on a Dodge Ram pick-up good quality easy plug and play.', u'The light color 6,000 K is perfect.', u'Long term testing will needed to see about lamp life.', u\"item working good so far one light doesn't come on once in a while I just turn my truck off and restart it or could just need to warm up first hasn't happened in a few days other than that it would have gotten 5 stars.\", u'I can see very well with this system they are brighter than my high beams very nice and work well for the money!!!!!!', u\"oh one thing I noticed is that the lights aren't the color of blue they advertise in the photo nothing near it there light blue like sky blue not dark blue but im happy with them.update: I cleared the check engine codes and so far the lights are working as they should very happy with them for the price.\", u\"It's the best brand you can get for the best quality that will last longer than those other brands on the market!\", u'Since, there are a lot HID products in the market.Its hardly to compare who is the most reliable product and seller.', u\"I observed from varies review stated that different products, either the light won't stable to work or seller had poor service, even though they skip away from their business.\", u'I bought this Kensun HID-H4 is base on the review and this is one had higher review score.', u'so, I make up my mind to try one of it.', u'It set up fast and simple(only 20 minutes), the light given out is straight sharp turn on and the light is bright enough to lights up all around.the Kelvin is quite close as its described.', u'The Seller has instant response to any question you may have.', u'In my mind, for such $80.00 or whatever, that is good enough.', u'Compare to use high performance Xenon bulb, you will find it is worth to try one of this.', u'Even it last for 2 years.', u'I have had these installed now for a few weeks.', u'I absolutely love them!', u'Took around 30 minutes to install, hardest part was getting my factory headlight bulbs out( 2012 Ford Escape).', u'Wiring harness that came with the HID kit was easy to install, everything could only go in 1 place.', u'Quality seems very good, ballasts are metal.', u'The directions are in &#34;Engrish&#34;, however, I used the picture diagram.', u'And, like I said, everything can only plug in 1 way.Worked the first time I turned on my headlights, no flickering or anything.', u'They are INCREDIBLY BRIGHT!', u\"Make sure your headlights are adjusted properly so you don't blind oncoming traffic.\", u'I ordered the 8k color bulbs( super white with blue tinge) They are exactly as described, a little more blue than I was expecting.', u'But, overall, I am very satisfied with the color.', u'I had to order LED fog light bulbs to match them.Night time driving is a blast now, highway signs POP.', u'The kit was extremely easy to install and had everything I needed.', u'It works great and is so much brighter than the old halogens.', u'I got the 6000K bulbs and they are exactly what I was looking for.', u'A little blue tint that looks cool and lets people know I have Xenons and yet not outrageously blue like the 10000K.', u\"I considered the 8000K but I think I made the right choice.I'd recommend doing this mod.\", u'Its easy and definitely worth it.I would also recommend aiming your headlights very carefully after installation.', u'Its better to aim them a little further down than stock just because they are significantly brighter.', u\"Please don't blind people.\", u\"Xenons really weren't meant to be in reflector housings to begin with.\", u'Installed in the fog lights in a 2008 Jeep JKU.', u'You will need an HID relay harness for this vehicle but I knew this

After a general tune-upincluding changing filters and spark-plugs, when I first started themwith just no-lead gas, but they idled erratically, and at light throttle stumbled.After using about 8 ounces and running at fast idle (I re-set),they run smooth.', u'I have yet to try a load.', u'Purchased this for use in a Honda CRV that has had only regular oil changes over 60k miles, no other recommended maintenance other than brakes, filter .', u'I noticed a steady decline in mpg over the past 30k miles since break in from 28-29mpg over my regular commute to 26-27mpg and sometimes struggling to break 26.', u'(info from onboard computer and the old divide miles by gallons)  A mixture of highway and two lane, I drive it six days a week like clockwork.I put about 10oz of Red Line in the first tank, added 10 gallons to the mix at a 1/4 tank which gave a weaker dilution and then added the remaining 4oz to the third tank of fuel.', u'During the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd tankfuls I saw little change, but by the 4th tank mpg jumped up to an average of 28.8mpg and has now maintained this for over a month of commuting.', u'The road is the same, I always purchase gas at the same station and the numbers reflect both what the car is telling me and what my calculator is.', u\"For me it works and paid for it's self in three weeks of commuting, highly recommend.\", u'While this fuel system cleaner is pricey compared with many others, it has the highest amount of poly-ethyl-amine (PEA) and as a result it has a very bad smell.', u'However, it is the best fuel cleaner on the market, and I use it every oil change.', u'This is cheaper and is at least equivalent to the other popular fuel system cleaner by Amsoil.', u\"It is also about 3x stronger than regular Techron, and it's about the same price when on sale.\", u'Excellent product, 5 stars.', u\"Like many reviewers, I think I've noticed a marginal improvement.\", u\"This could be how wonderful the product is, or it could be a placbo effect, as I'm biased and looking for improvement.I do know I had a '98 Buick that went through Injectors like most cars go through wiper blades.\", u\"If this prevents a $1,000 plus repair, I'm glad to buy a bottle or two a year.\", u'I bought the SI-1 due to the reported high concentration of the PEA additive that is found in Techron.', u'It pours out rather thick like a light-weight oil versus a typical gasoline cleaner/additive.', u'I did not notice any significant change in startup, gas mileage, or vehicle performance after using the SI-1.Overall: 4/5 stars Love this product.', u'I notice the use of it right away.', u'The sound of the engine and the way it rides.', u'The price was even better than the other I was looking to use.', u'I got it faster than expected.', u'So I am going to use it in the other vehicle as well as this one.', u'A great product you must use at least once in a while.', u'Really does make a difference on your vehicle.', u'I poped this in after I had already seafoamed my fuel tank to empty and my oil.', u'This had increased my MPG by 1-2 not bad!', u\"After buying this, I'm now a Redline products fan for life.\", u'This simply is the best fuel system cleaner that your money can buy, period.', u'I own a 1987 chevy silverado 5.7L TBI engine truck.', u'I had a problem with it idling rough.', u'It would idle a little bit rough once the engine warmed up, and a lot rough when the engine was cold.', u'After using this stuff, I sometimes think that the engine has died.', u\"When it hasn't, its just idling so smooth.\", u'And that is not the only problem it cured.', u\"I used to have to run 93 octane if I didn't want to hear some bad valve clatter.\", u'It was rattling noise from the engine.', u'After using this, I can run 87 octane with no valve clatter at all.', u\"Needless to say, I'm VERY impressed with this product.\", u\"And to top it all off, its freakin' cheap!\", u'Ten bucks!', u\"I'm going to be buying more of this stuff, needless to say.\", u'This product, Chevron Techron fuel system cleaner, and CRC Guaranteed-to-Pass fuel system cleaner are the only products that have been proven with results to work.', u'Redline makes incredible products, especially their transmission fluid.', u\"Used a bottle in the wife's DI engine.\", u\"After running a tankful through the engine, the mpg went back to it's norm, and the peppiness has returned.\", u\"I put a bottle in the tank of my '95 Honda cbr 900, 3 weeks later my carbs started spitting out fuel from an air ventHose.I'm guessing the problem with the bike resulted from fuel system cleaner,(& maybe the fact it's an 18 y/o bike).Which is a testament to how effective the product is.i still recommend gunk can build up from the air intake side and from the fuel intake side.\", u\"My engine was not idling very smoothly and I did a throttle body clean but that didn't entirely solve the problem.\", u'I used this and it solved it.', u'Not sure how much help this contributed but it was noticeable.', u\"I didn't see any MPG improvement.\", u'As many of the reviews already published here have mentioned, this product contains PEA, a very good cleaner.', u'I find the Redline product to be a good balance of a good strong cleaner, as well as a good upper cylinder lubricant.', u'Not to mention Redline has a near bulletproof reputation.', u'I use this product in all of our vehicles which include; 2012 Kia Optima Turbo w/ 6800 miles, 2003 Toyota Corolla with 108K miles, and a 1977 F250.', u'All of these vehicles are very different; an economy car, a turbocharged 274hp 4 cylinder, and a built big block.', u'But they all benefit from using SI-1 regularly.I choose to use this product as a maintenance dose (1.5 ounces per 10 gallons), along with a full bottle cleaning once a year.', u'For $10.95/bottle, it gives me peace of mind knowing the fuel system is being kept in tip top shape.', u'This holds especially true for the Kia, which is turbocharged and direct injection.', u'The Corolla runs as good now with 108,000 miles as when we bought it with 25,000 miles.', u'Still feels like it has the same amount of power and fuel economy has stayed consistent.', u'I attribute this to using synthetic fluids changed at reasonable intervals, and using Redline SI-1 regularly for the fuel system.', u\"Poured a bottle in my wife's 2002 Toyota Avalon with 160,000 miles that was hesitating during start up like it wasn't getting enough gas.\", u'After running a tank of gas through the car the problem has subsided.', u'From what I can tell from my research, this contains the same ingrediants as in Techron.', u\"I put in an ounce or two each time we fill it up somewhere that doesn't have Techron in their gas already (like Sam's & Costco).\", u\"We aren't consistant enough to know if it makes a difference in gas mileage or not, but my hope is that doing this prevents us from having to do a fuel system cleaning.\", u'Tried this in my Tundra to see if I could clear up a weird hesitation issue after changing plugs, cleaning sensors, etc, etc.', u\"No change after using, but I've read many good things about this product.\", u\"I'm going to order another and try it in some lawn equipment next :) In short, I put two bottles into my car and the mileage went up about 10%, which I am very happy with.Long version:I have a 2004 Infiniti G35 Coupe 6 Speed (Manual) that now has about 76000 miles on it.\", u\"The car has some modifications (cool air intake, lightweight pulleys, lightweight flywheel) that could affect fuel mileage, but theoretically they shouldn't (or at least not much).\", u'All maintenance is done on time - car is well taken care of.Either way, my car is rated to 19/26 city/hwy, and I drive a combination of approximately 35%/65% city/hwy (this is actually conservative, the highway distance is probably more), but was only managing 17.5-18mpg per tank on average.', u\"I never expect to get the full EPA ratings since I drive faster than 65 on the highway and don't have a feather light foot when driving around town, but I didn't expect it to be THAT bad.So I was reading around on the multiple car forums I'm on, and was recommended this stuff.\", u'So I went ahead and bought 3 bottles of this stuff.', u'I put one in our truck (2009 Dodge Ram 1500 w/ Hemi) and 2 bottles in my G35 (I put one in when I filled up, and the second the next time I filled up).With my driving style being the same, my mileage has gone up now to about 19.5-20mpg, which is a pretty solid 10% increase.', u\"I held off on posting but I've put at least 20 tanks through my car since I used this stuff and the mileage increase is holding steady (if not getting better).\", u\"As far as I know I have not done anything else differently that may skew my results.I haven't been monitoring the truck's mileage and since it gets driven by many different people I can't comment on the difference on that vehicle, but so far it's made a difference on my car.\", u\"I'll probably end up throwing a bottle or two of this stuff into my car every 5-10K miles.\", u\"Before anyone argues that you spend more money that way, at the mileage increase I got, I'm saving nearly 28 gallons of fuel every 5000 miles.\", u\"Gas costs about 3.25 a gallon where I live (car takes premium) so that's over 90 bucks worth saved for spending 10-20 bucks on this stuff.\", u'Seems logical to me.', u'The engine in my 93 Pathfinder will die when first started for the day especially during cold weather.', u'My mechanic suggested trying some type of fuel system cleaner.', u'I try to use Chevron gas because it has Techron, in minimal amount of course but after all these years it may be dirty in there.', u'I love this car so I like to keep it running well.I say it seems to have helped because it does run better now but it is also warming up.', u'I will continue to add this every 3000 miles or so and see if I have any issues next winter.', u\"I don't drive this car that often so I won't need a lot.\", u\"Which also may be why it's gummed up.\", u'Wish me luck!', u'My 2010 Hyundai was hesitating which was very annoying, I put a container in my fuel tank and it took care of the problem which kept on getting worse.', u'When you wanted to rapidly accelerate you would get a hesitation instead.', u'For a comprehensive review see the #1 review by Glenn Carpenter.', u\"My gas mileage went up by 2 mpg.My friend's 2013 Hyundai Sonata developed the same problem, the Red Line fixed his problem as well.The active ingredient works very well.\", u'The Amsoil PI that I used before I purchased the Red Line worked very well in my 1994 Toyota curing the hard to start after the truck sat for three months and improved the performance.If you have a problem or want to prevent them Red Line is the best.', u'We have a 1997 Chevy Venture van with 215,000 miles on it.', u'A few months ago, the van began to develop a slight hesitation at low RPM when under light to moderate throttle.', u\"Over the following few weeks, the hesitation slowly worsened and when replacing the fuel filter didn't clear up the problem, our mechanic neighbor suggested we try a quality fuel system cleaner.\", u'Knowing from experience that many fuel additives are completely worthless, I did a lot of research before deciding to give Red Line a shot.', u'Having thoroughly read many of the other Amazon reviews, I decided to add three ounces of Red Line to five consecutive 15 gallon fill-ups.', u'The result was that somewhere into the third tankful, the hesitation slowly began to fade, and by the time we finished the last of the additive in our fifth tank, the engine was running as good as new.', u'I plan on keeping a bottle on hand and adding three ounces every few tankfuls to help maintain the health of the fuel system.', u\"I have never not used this stuff, so it's hard to claim improvement.\", u'However, my 2001 GM minivan (130,000 miles) and 1995 Eldorado (120,000 miles) start, idle, and run like new cars.', u'With regular fuel and air filter changes (at 40,000 and 30,000 miles respectively)and a bottle of SI-1 at every oil change, both vehicles still have the original fuel pumps, and the fuel injection systems have never been touched.', u'Spark plugs were changed in each vehicle at 80,000 and looked great.', u\"It's hard to improve on that.\", u'I swear by this stuff and will continue to use the SI-1.', u'2008 Subaru Outback, 100K miles.', u'300 highway mile trip south on day one, 460 miles on tank.', u'Same gas station, 2 days later north on same road, same weather conditions, 510 miles per tank.', u'Next tank, 520 miles.', u\"this stuff is powerful works good but not sure is it doing any better than little cheaper alternatives as long as it works can't complain This item is not a miracle item that will get you 100 more miles to the tank it is designed to prevent ware and premature failure of your fuel injectors or your engine's intake system.\", u\"Seems to work, can't tell if its really doing anything but if I have no problems then it must be working.\", u'Lol']\n"

      "[u'I wanted to wait until I had a change to use this controller towing a heavy load before writing a review.', u'I had that chance this past weekend.I have a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee with the Eco Diesel and I used it to tow a load of 7000lbs for about a 6 hour ride.', u'The trailer brakes, and controller, worked flawlessly.', u'The controller was easy to set and it worked very proportionally.', u\"The brake application was very linear.That doesn't mean everything is perfect.\", u'From an operational standpoint I am very happy.', u\"The installation itself wasn't bad either.\", u'My only issue is with the remote display and remote manual brake control unit.', u'Both are larger than I would have liked and that is especially the case with the manual brake control.', u'In trying to find a spot for the both of them their size caused some issues.', u\"It's not that they are so large they won't fit places, it's that they are large enough that it is difficult to make them inconspicuous when installed and not in use.With the display once the rubber bezel and pivoting mount is removed it is much better.\", u'It would have been nice though it had much less depth.', u'To the point of being able to have the back of the unit stuck to a flat surface facing the driver.', u'It is deep enough that about the only real choice is to mount it on the top of the dash somewhere.', u'I wound up placing it on the dash top just in front of the A pillar.', u\"When not in use it is a little more noticeable than I'd like but not terrible.\", u'Also, without the ball mount, being just Velcroed to the dash top, it is not perfectly angled to the driver.', u\"Using the ball mount you can angle it any way you'd like but for me the ball mount was far too bulky.\", u'In the end it works.For the manual brake control it is far more bulky and thus harder to find an inconspicuous place for it.', u'Ultimately I mounted it to the knee bolster very as low and to the outside of the drivers compartment as possible.', u'It is quite large.', u\"I'd have preferred it to be at least 1/2 its size.The whole idea of having the three parts of this setup separate instead of a single unit is to allow flexible and &#34;custom&#34; installation.\", u'When you take their bulkiness and then add in somewhat substantial cables, it makes a true lay custom or integrated look very difficult.Even with these difficulties I am giving this item 5 stars, just barely though.', u'The reason is, it is still better than a standard brake controller for reduced bulk and it works very well.', u'Just be prepared to take some time to get it installed in a manner you would like and keep in mind it will be very hard to get a truely integrated look.', u'For best performance, trailer brake controllers need to be accessible to the driver, but still out of the way since they are not needed most of the time during normal driving.', u'Cheaper models seem to be hard to get to when needed, but still somehow in the way when not needed.', u\"This controller is split into parts with a digital display that has been made small to put in the driver's line of sight, and other parts that can be tucked away out of sight.\", u\"It's a clever design, and nicely made, making it worth it though it costs more.\", u'OK, when it comes to vehicles I hate playing with wiring of any kind.', u'Maybe because so many friends are mechanics.', u'I had one of them wire everything up for me.', u\"As for use, it's straightforward.\", u'Automatic braking is inertia activated.', u'The manual over-ride is fully adjustable.', u\"I also don't tow a trailer that much - maybe a dozen times a year, so I really don't want all this stuff in the way.\", u'I used velcro on the control and LED display, and tuck them out of the way when not in use.', u'The control box was mounted on the inside instead of the outside of a panel - again, I wanted it out of the way.Read the instructions, watch the video.', u'You can also find the correct wiring harness on the company website.', u\"The Hopkins 47297 INSIGHT Brake Control Advanced brake control works on trailers with electric or hydraulic brakes, and its' digital power source provides short proof protection for up to eight trailer brakes.\", u'The separate components mount where you want them without drilling, providing for easy installation.', u'This review is somewhat delayed.', u'The unit comes with a generic cable used to attach it to the vehicles braking system and power.', u'This cable is for use with a vehicle that does NOT come with a \"Factory Equipped Trailer Tow Package\".', u'This is understandable as there must be a zillion different sizes and shapes of tow vehicles.', u'My vehicle, a Chev 2500 diesel, did come with a towing package.', u'Consequently I have ordered the correct cable from Hopkins.', u'Once it arrives, should be a simple process to hook it up and test the braking system.Present observations:Units, there are 3 pieces, look well made.', u'The display itself is smaller then I expected,  about inch high and a tad wider.The cables will for sure be long enough for just about any placement of the three units.', u'(Control box, display and manual brake control)  They appear to be heavy enough without being stiff so can be routed easily.I\\'ll update this review when the \"Tow Package\" cable ($7 additional) arrives and is units are installed and tested.UPDATE:  Using the cable Hopkins sent for my vehicle, installation was a 10 minute job.THE UP-SIDE:The cables for the various pieces/parts were long enough, flexible and sturdy.I was easily able to place the LED display, the manual brake control and control box for easy visibility and access.After setup, braking was good.', u'Worked very well towing my 30 foot double axle travel trailer.THE DOWN SIDE:The LED display is smaller than need be.', u\"It's also not bright enough to be really useful in the sunlight.Unlike my Tekonsha brake controller (which I've reconnected and am using again) the Hopkins unit apparently releases the trailer brakes when at a full stop even though the tow vehicle brakes are activated.\", u'At least the display reverted to zero at each full stop.The display and manual stop units have no provision to permanently  attach them anywhere.', u\"Yes, you might use double sticky tape but that's a temporary measure especially when the truck may get to be 140 degrees inside after sitting all day in 100 degree sunlight.Conclusion:  Hopkins has a great idea here if some minor improvements are made.\", u'A larger,brighter display.', u'Partial brakes at full stop.', u'Ways to hard attached all the units.']\n"

      "[u'it works alright.', u\"it kind of smears, especially on glass, and doesn't wash that great.\", u\"If its a must have then i guess it's worth it but i wouldn't recommend.\", u'This is a new consumer product from Meguiars.', u'However, the concept of water-less washes has been around for some time now.', u'When this product came out I was skeptical, especially since it is not yet at this point widely available just anywhere, combined with the fact that a bottle of this stuff goes for as high as about $15.00.About me:  I am a mobile automotive detailer/car enthusiast.', u'I also have extensive knowledge in auto body and paint as well.', u'I have replaced rusted out panels on my own vehicle, have done my share of welding, and I have also repainted my own truck.', u'If you were to browse my profile and other reviews you would quickly learn that I am an avid Meguiars product loyalist and typically rate their products no less than 4 star ratings/reviews.My vehicle/weather conditions:  1994 Ford Bronco, BLACK, 95 degrees, semi shaded, cleaned, polished with a dual action buffer and waxed just one week prior to utilizing this product.', u'The vehicle was what should be expected when using a product like this, semi-dirty, but not gritty, grimy or considered filthy.Application:  Following the bottles instructions, I shook the contents of the product thoroughly, and grabbed a total of 4 microfiber towels, even though the product advised 2 for best results.', u'Why 4?', u'My vehicle is large, I am a detailer and I do not roll the dice on my newer paint job, or anyones, for that matter.', u'I began with the top of the vehicle, sprayed product, wiped product in one direction, and wiped again with the other clean/fresh towel.', u'I repeated this throughout the entire process until the vehicle was complete and switched to two new towels only half way through the job ONLY applying product to the painted surfaces and working my way from the upper most panels while saving the lowest panels for last.Results:  Once the job was complete I did a walk around of the entire vehicle.', u'First, I noticed a few spots where the product streaked and smudged to a haze.', u'This could have been my error, but I did follow the directions and thought that I was doing things right.', u'Overall, not a big deal, I just re-applied a little bit more and wiped off with another clean towel.', u'Next, I noticed some light surface scratching in a couple of spots, one, on the hood, and two on my passenger side door.', u'Remember, I just buffed this a week ago and gave it a thorough inspection post buffing and waxing and I did not have these on my vehicle.', u'THIS WAS MY PRIMARY CONCERN WITH THIS OR ANY WATER LESS WASH PRODUCT.', u\"This was the main reason I didn't rush out to buy the product as soon as it was released.Overall:  If you are 100% on keeping your vehicle in PRISTINE condition I highly recommend on sticking to the conventional way of cleaning things and using water.\", u'My business relies on my vehicle looking amazing, if my vehicle was always dirty, scratched and grimy I probably would not have much of a selling point.', u'However, this product may be great for enthusiasts who wish to wipe down their vehicle every other day or as soon as it starts collecting light dust or finger prints.', u'I have never been huge on wash and wax products combined, although, they are better than nothing.', u'I believe Meguiars is on the right path with this product.', u\"However, if you have an extremely dark colored or black vehicle or an extremely expensive paint job I couldn't pull myself together to recommend a product like this to use on a regular basis.\", u\"It certainly isn't a regular basis substitute for doing things the old fashioned way.Notes:  It says it can be used on glass and other surfaces.\", u'Yes, it can be.', u'But, why would you want to at the cost per bottle?', u\"Save the windows for being cleaned with glass cleaner, don't start spraying down everything you own with this stuff.\", u\"One final note I'd like to say and it's a positive one at that.\", u'The bottle says cleans 3-4 vehicles and that might hold true if you are figuring all of the surfaces top to bottom, glass included.', u'But, I cleaned all of the painted surfaces of my truck with this bottle and the painted surfaces alone and I could EASILY do at least 5 more washes with this stuff (if I really wanted to).', u'I will try it again in a couple of days, perhaps I just need more practice with their product.', u\"But, I have tried other water-less washes and have had better results, such as Optimum no rinse.Closing:  Don't expect this product to take out water spots.\", u'I had some spotting on my hood after it rained out and happened to dry on the vehicle and this product did fade/blend the spots down a little but did not remove the stubborn ones.I hope this somewhat critical review helped.', u'I love Meguiars about as much as anyone else but like to say things as I see them.', u\"I wouldn't want every single person rushing out to get a bottle of this only to be somewhat disappointed.\", u'I understand that not everyone is so picky about keeping a vehicle looking as perfect as possible and if you have a lighter colored car or silver than you might not mind this product so much.', u'Finally, this product smells like a strong fruity bubble gum type of smell.', u\"It's nice at first but if you're around it long enough it gets overwhelming.\", u\"I'd recommend to wash your hands afterwords, no, not with this stuff, with soap and water!\"]\n",

really is a big convenience).This jack is very light compared to others 2-ton jacks and I love the dual piston feature this has.', u'The pumping action is indeed quick.', u'The jack stands are also a

great.', u'They have a pin to lock them into place which makes me feel really safe.', u\"They're also really light and convenient.4.\", u'Build quality seems great and the jack and stands are

      "[u'I ordered this unit to be able to power my various chargers, but most importantly my Li-ion 18v cordless drill/ impact driver charger which claims to consume 250 watts, which I found surprisingly high as I was looking at a 120 watt Samlex.I do have an older Coleman 800 watt MSW inverter but it has destroyed some other battery chargers in the past and I no longer take the chance of it releasing the magic blue smoke.I only got the unit yesterday, and I used it, through the ciggy plug adapter to recharge some 14500 Li-ion batteries and to power my 90 watt power brick for my laptop.', u'My battery voltage was 12.1 at the time, and the alarm started sounding on the inverter off and on when powering the laptop and charging the dead Li-ion battery within.Anyway I plan on hardwiring this into my RV with a 50 amp fuse.What I like is that it is so quiet.', u'My coleman inverter uses 0.9 amps just turned on powering nothing, and the small fan, which I have replaced once already, is annoyingly loud and runs full speed, always.', u'This unit consumed only 0.3 amps turned on powering nothing, and I have not heard the fan turn on, even when my laptop was drawing 90 watts through it.I have not checked the actual voltage under load, nor maxed it out yet, nor have any idea how long it will continue to operate, but this unit does give me the capability to live completely off the grid, and to use my solar excess where as before I had to use the grid to power the chargers which might protest the modified square wave inverterIt comes in a hard to open blister pack, and this was kind of loose in the Amazon box and flopping around inside of it.', u\"It could have been packed better but seems to not have suffered any damage in shipping This true sine-wave inverter offers a fantastic value and so far, in the last month I've owned it, it has worked flawlessly in my rv.\", u'I am using it exclusively for right now to operate my Omega juicer and it runs the unit flawlessly keeping me in healthy juices every day!', u'It arrived days earlier than the stated expected delivery date, so you need not be concerned, at least from my experience, that the seller would offer anything but the best service to you.', u'When I saw how big this thing was I was skeptical.', u'I mean, my 1,500 watt inverter that I bought back in 2004 is only a bit larger!', u\"However, this unit performs well, doesn't get hotter than I would expect, and can be left on for a long time without overheating.\", u\"I haven't had it long enough to say if it will last, but for a first few weeks impression I am very pleased!\", u\"This Wagan power inverter is a great solution when those smaller power inverters for your car just can't supply enough power.\", u'A good example would be if you need to run a printer or a desktop PC in your car.', u'Electronics really need clean power, and the Wagan provides a nice source of power that more accurately emulates the sinusoid of wall power.', u'That being said, do you need a 400W supply?', u\"The inverter comes with a cigarette lighter adapter and clips to put directly on a battery, but if you are going through the car's cigarette lighter, note that you can only go to 150W.\", u'This is not a limitation of Wagan, but a limitation of your car.', u'If you intend to use your cigarette lighter only, then buy a smaller inverter.The one downside is that I noticed the internal fan is a little noisy, especially under heavy load.', u\"From what I can tell however, this is a fine choice for occasional needs of higher power such as a printer, desktop PC, or small television so long as you connect it directly to the car power system and don't use the lighter.\", u\"I like the feature set on Wagan's EL2601 Inverter.\", u'Multiple 3-prong outlets are to be expected at this price point, but the USB charging outlet is a nice plus.', u\"It can handle a substantial load (400W, though if you're running it from a cigarette lighter outlet it will cap it at 150 to protect your vehicle) and is virtually silent at the smaller loads (&lt;50 watts), and not loud even at full force.The box itself is pretty hardy, and comes with built-in mounting holes, though I wish the ones in the rear were a little closer to the edge so the terminals weren't in the way as much; my power screwdriver couldn't get to the screws and I had to go with a regular screwdriver.The inverter comes with two sets of cables - a DC plug for the cigarette lighter, and alligator clamps for direct connection to the battery.\", u'The clamps were my biggest issue with the inverter - namely, the fact that the rubber grips tend to slip off, which is more than a little worrisome.', u'I also would have like to see a more permanent cable option, such as a terminal connector, for long-term connections.', u'I\\'m using my inverter in conjunction with a leftover power mower battery and a solar panel to provide light-load electric power in a shed, and had to get creative hooking things up as both the panel and the inverter only came with DC plugs and clamps.I haven\\'t really tested the \"pure sine\" claim extensively, given my application, but the fluorescent lights I\\'m using seem to flicker less with this inverter than others I\\'ve used, so there\\'s that.The inverter will give a high-pitched beep when it loses power or is turned off, so keep that in mind if you\\'re attaching it on the downstream side of a switch.All in all though, a few gripes aside, this is a quality product that performs as advertised.', u'There are two points that struck me to mention first.~ 1.', u\"The obvious ~ But in this case more critical then usual.Be sure to always attach the polarity connection correctly, red to red & black to black.General instruction: (pg 3) 'Incorrect battery polarity will damage the inverter & void the warranty.Do not open the inverter, there are no user serviceable parts inside.This inverter has 'reverse polarity protection'  by means of an internal fuse, but the instructions state:(pg 7 #2) 'Reverse polarity connection will blow the fuse in the inverter & can permanently damage the inverter.Damage caused by reverse polarity will void the warranty'~ 2.\", u'All WAGAN Corporation products must be registered within 30 days of purchase to activate the warranty.Replacement products will be in warranty for the balance of the original 2 year warranty.This is an nice inverter, with more available wattage then our family would commonly need on a road trip.But this is also handy to run our desktop computer (approx 300 watts) and a lamp (approx 100 watts)for a while during a power outage.It will provide a suggested 140 watts plugged in the cigarette lighter, (Not to exceed 150 watts)That amount will power a medium size LCD -T.V.', u\"(approx 70 watts) ~ OR a laptop computer (approx 90 watts)plus other items at the same time up to 140 watts.The inverter has a USB power port compatible with iPad & tablet, for charging mobile electronics,but this kit doesn't include the USB cable that would be needed.For additional wattage over 140 up to the 400 watts this inverter will provide,it needs to be connected to the automobile/boat/RV battery (neutral to ground bond for marine applications)~ 1.\", u'Included are two cables ~ a 42\" cigarette lighter/accessory adapter & 31\" long battery cable clips.There is adequate holding of the ring connectors on the threaded terminals of 3 1/4 turns when onlyone set of cables at a time are connected.~ 2.', u'The inverter runs up to 90% efficiency which supports longer running time & greater care of the battery.~ 3.', u'Inverter has Two AC outlets which provide up to 3.3 amps.~ 4.', u'One USB port which powers up to 5 volts at 2.1 Amps.~ 5.', u'Short circuit protection is by means of automatic shut down.~ 6.', u'Overload, overheat and low battery protection ~ automatic shut down.~ 7.', u\"If shut down is preceded by a buzzing sound it's possible there's excessive load or a low battery or cable problem.~ 8.\", u'All inverters will automatically shut off when the battery discharges to 9.5 volts.This lower remaining amount of battery voltage will still start the vehicle.~ 9.', u'For T.V.', u'and audio equipment the inverter is shielded to minimize signal interference,but it may effect T.V.', u'picture anyway.Wagan offers suggestions what to do, among others ~ move the T.V.', u'away from the inverter by running an extension cordbetween the inverter and T.V.~ 10.', u'To help reduce the noise caused by power conversion when using radio frequency devices ~connect an insulated copper wire to the ground terminal ~ and the other end should be connectedto a proper grounding point.Some examples are listed.', u'The harmonic distortion is 3% which is rather high.A start-up load is approximately twice the continuous load which is why this inverter has a peak of 800 watts.Wagan suggests to determine if an item will operate with this inverter, do a test run.', u'\"This inverter will automatically shut down in the event of an output overload, so there\\'s no danger of damagingeither the inverter or the equipment.\"', u\"A red LED light signals a fault.BUT ~ DON'T exceed 800 watts which will blow a fuse.To do the math ~ multiply the amps listed on the item times 120 (120V AC) to finds the wattsAll Wagan Tech inverters feature True-rated Power(tm).\", u'Which means power is tested and rated at a periodof 24 hours continuous usage under full load.Wagan says the competition claims \"continuous\", when in fact, they are often only 30 minutes \"continuous\".Afterwords, the competition\\'s output wattage will drop down as much as 30% of the claimed wattage Up Front:  I found the Wagan 2601 Elite 400 Watt PRO Pure Sine Wave Power Inverter well built and easy to install in my RV.Before installing the unit I put it on the bench with a steady input voltage of 12.9 volts DC.', u'With no load on the unit I measured 124 volts AC.', u'I attached a 300 watt TV and again measured the output voltage and it remained steady at 119 Volts.', u'Adding a 100 watt light bulb to the load dropped the voltage to 115 volts.', u'The unit was warm approaching very warm to the touch after a 400 watt constant load of 2 hours.The unit is not a silent inverter.', u\"It's not loud, but you know it's running.\", u'The noise is mostly from the fan I suspect.', u'It comes with a cigarette lighter plug, as well as battery clamps.', u'I ran #12 wiring to the battery bank in the RV.', u'In an auto using the cigarette lighter plug I suspect the output voltage will be dependent on the size wiring from the cigarette lighter outlet to the vehicles battery.', u'For a full 400 watt output it might need a heavier wire connection then most 12 Volt DC outlets are supplied with.One item of note:  When plugged into the autos cigarette lighter outlet and using a full 400 watt device that has a higher surge to start up, it may overload the vehicles cigarette outlet fuse and blow the fuse.', u'I was not able to measure the amps the unit draws however so this is speculation.Installation is straight forward and the mounting brackets on the unit are strong and helpful.', u\"I've been testing the Wagan EL2601 Elite for a few weeks with my DIY solar power panel system and 12 volts sealed lead acid batteries.\", u'So far it performs great.During the last year, we endured more than a week of power outage after bad storms crossed our town, and we depended of a couple of inverters I own to supply the essential electricity for lights and recharging devices.The only downside was that both were modified wave power inverters and produced interference with some of our electronics.', u'One of the storms happened in the middle of the summer, and when I tried to use an electric fan with the inverters the noise that the modified wave DC produced was unbearable.', u'I ended using a couple of D cell batteries powered fans instead.A true sine wave inverter, like the Wagan EL2601 Elite provides a pure signal which will not interfere with the sensitive electronic gadgets at all.', u'The Wagan EL2601 Elite has a very low harmonic distortion, THD &lt; 3% and the first thing I did was to try the electric fan with it, this time there is no perceivable noise at all.I also tested it with fluorescent lamps, USB lights, a laptop and charging my cell phone.', u\"I'm so pleased that I'll be getting a second one, and I recommend it for sure.\", u'This is a useful device for anyone who takes road trips.', u'I can charge my laptop as well as my iPhone or iPad at the same time via the built in USB charge port, while on a car trip via the accessory power jack in my car.', u\"If I'm traveling with the kids, they can charge their Nintendo DS systems, etc.\", u'also.If you need to power something that takes more power such as a power drill or something like that, you need to plug this directly to your car battery to avoid blowing the accessory jack fuse in your car.', u\"It's nice that this comes with both types of plugs.\", u\"I would also recommend you do this with the car running so you don't burn out your car battery, however this device does include an alarm that beeps when your car battery is getting low.\", u'It is supposed to warn you before the point where the car battery drains to a point of not being able to start the car, although I have not tried this yet.This unit is lighter and feels a bit less quality than I expected at this price and it remains to be seen how reliable it is over the long term.', u'That said, it appears to be functioning well so far.']\n"

      "[u'Easy to mount and adjust.', u'Since each one is made identical (there is no right or left, you just mount the mirror differently), one has the tensioner lever right next to the mirror (drivers side in my case).', u'That is not a problem if you place it back from your mirror.', u'Good sturdy mount and no vibration.', u'Once adjusted they are easy on and off.', u\"I bought a pair of these to use while pulling a 17' Bowrider type boat behind a 2007 Ford Ranger.\", u'With just the stock mirrors, any traffic directly behind the boat was absolutely invisible to me.', u'With the mirrors, that is no longer the case.I had two problems initially: one due to my own ineptness and the other due to being alone.', u'When I first got these out of the box and clipped them into the bottom of the door and the window groove, the horizontal bar was not horizontal at all.', u'Adjusting the straps straightened that out completely.', u'Also, the mirrors appeared to be fixed in position and any effort to move them seemed as if it might break them.', u'Well, there are three Phillips head screws that encircle the adjustment ball; loosen them and you can move the mirror any way you want.The major problem remains adjusting the passenger side mirror.', u\"If I had somebody to move it for me, I could adjust it in just a minute while I sat in the driver's seat.\", u\"As it is, I had to get out, adjust the mirror, get back in, check the adjustment from the driver's seat and repeat ad nauseum until I finally got it right.\", u\"I don't fault the mirror for that.These mirrors come one to a box so you need to order two of them.\", u\"The image vibrates slightly but that doesn't really matter in practice:  I'm just looking to see if anything is behind the boat.\", u'It will tell me that.', u'I highly recommend these mirrors.', u'I did a lot of looking and comparing before I bought these.', u'I have a 2006 Toyota Tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job.', u'They vibrate a little but not excessive.', u\"The little bit of vibration I see doesn't interfere with my view.\", u'I also do not extend them very far.', u'The further out you go with them the more they will vibrate.', u\"Just extend to the minimum needed in order to be able to see.Before attaching to the vehicle I think it's a good idea to loosen the three screws holding the swivel in place on the bottom of the mirrors and work in a drop of oil.\", u'Then do not over tighten these screws.', u\"They don't have to be very tight to hold the mirror still and not over tightening allows easy adjustment later.\", u'If you find they move when you close the door you can tighten a little more but to start off, finger tight with the screwdriver is all you need.', u'I also placed a couple drops of oil on the aluminum sliding bar and worked it in before attaching.', u'Also, when you bolt the mirror onto the aluminum slide bar, grip the base (the part with the internal threads) with a vise-grip or something (not too tight to crush it), then make sure the lock nut is between the bolt and the bar on the bottom, and then screw the bolt into the base (and through the aluminum slide bar) nice and tight without letting the base turn.', u\"You'll notice there are &#34;teeth&#34; on the bottom of the base.\", u'These are supposed to sink into the bar as you tighten the bolt.', u'They keep the base from turning when you adjust the mirror.', u'This is another good reason to not overtighten the three screws around the swivel.', u'You want to be able to adjust the mirror from side to side and have it turn only at the swivel and without causing the base to turn against the aluminum slide bar.The bracket will bend the weather stripping on the outside of the window a little.', u'It springs back when the mirror is removed but some of it will be permanent.', u\"It's not a big deal and you'll just have to deal with this if you want to use these mirrors.\", u'It is not a detriment to the operation of the window.I installed them as far forward as possible so that the top of the bracket was parallel to the ground and the new mirror sits right beside my existing one towards the outside.', u'Tightening the ratchet by hand produced plenty of tension to hold it securely.', u'Releasing the ratchet is another matter.', u\"It's too tight to just push it down with your finger.\", u'To release the tension I use a short piece of rope and loop it under the sliding buckle.', u'Then I stand right next to the truck with the rope looped around one hand and my other hand on the ratchet release tab.', u'I use my body leverage (knees and back) to pull upward on the rope a little which takes just enough pressure off the belt to allow me to press the ratchet release tab.', u\"You don't need to back the ratchet off very far - just enough to get the hook out from under the door.\", u\"Then just close up the bracket and wrap up the belt around it and you're all pre-set for the next time.For better stability I advise when you're adjusting the belt, place the sliding buckle as necessary so that the crossbar forming the angle is not extended very far, if at all.\", u\"And, yes, make sure there isn't any dirt behind the buckle or you'll get a scuff mark.You should have the windows all the way down when attaching to the vehicle.\", u'The bracket comes close to the window so you need to be careful not to let it scratch the window.', u'After you get the mirror on I advise to raise the window very slowly to make sure that the metal bracket is not contacting (scratching) the window as you raise it.', u\"Once you're under way - be sure not to lower the window if there is any sand or debris laying on the bracket right next to the window or a scratch may occur from this action also.\", u\"I've taken these off and on several times now and we've travelled with them and I've been relatively careful and have never had one scratch my window.On my truck, the doors fit really well and I can tell the difference when the hook for the mirror strap is hooked under the door.\", u'The door fits just a tad more tightly than usual.', u'It has to be closed just a slight bit harder to make the latch engage and when I open the door it pops out ever so slightly because of the extra tension produced by the hook being in there on the bottom.', u\"I don't see this as a problem.\", u'The mirrors are not on there all the time and, even if they were, I think the latch mechanism on the Toyota is stout enough to handle it without any long term problems developing.', u'Just be aware that the hook will slightly change thge way the door latches.The instructions are good, too.', u'Not the usual loosely translated Mandarin.', u\"I've tried to supplement here with my own experience.\", u'These mirrors are the best that I have found for towing a travel trailer.', u'They are easily installed and they do not vibrate at all.', u'The field of view is goodsnd When not towing a trailer, they are easily removed for storage.', u'I loved these for my Honda Odyssey minivan.', u'Easy to use and install.', u'Very well built.', u'I would easily recommend these!']\n",

no streaking , squeaking or stutters but certainly not anything to write a review about or in any manner that was noticeably superior to its' less costly and much older companion.\", u\"That's when the real test started as it was the driver side mechanism that failed.\", u\"As I leaned towards the center of the car, I did have a smidgen of regret that the passenger side wiper wasn't the longer of the two.\", u\"And it became abundantly evident while the wiper was effectively clearing a bit over half the window, the way Rain-x dissipated the snow flakes and road mist was more impressive.I suppose in the long view (sic), I'll probably replace the other blade with one these beam technology models since they are purported to have a longer life span but for the moment I'm not convinced the significantly higher cost is worth it to me.\", u'These Bosch wiper blades work great.Pros+ They leave the window completely clean, no streaks+ They look good, classier than your average blades+ Very simple to installCons- None I just replaced these exact blades that I had on my S10 pickup for three years.', u'I had originally purchased them based on Amazon recommendations.They just recently started to streak so I felt it was time for a change.', u'These blades are sold separately as A and B.', u'The instructions on the package show that A is mounted on the drivers side.', u\"As before, about 1/8 inch on the outside edge of the passenger side blade does not touch the windshield when it is at rest and doesn't wipe a very small part of that corner and yes I did purchase the right size.Overall I feel they live up to their reputation.\", u'Installation is simple and easy and I recommend this item.']\n"

this chamois, all I do is wipe the entire table one time, wring out the chamois, than wipe the table again.', u'Within minutes, the table is not only clean, but dry.', u'This is definitely worth the money.', u'This is an excellent chamois!', u'I have used many different kinds, in fact my last purchase from Amazon included this one as well as a fancy one with a waffle pattern design.', u\"Let's just say that this outperformed that other one and I am confident in saying that this does just as good of a job as a leather one, without the process of breaking it in.\", u'This is a great deal for the price.', u'Great for after washing your car or after a heavy rain.', u'The Absorber is made of polyvinyl alcohol which allows it to be super absorbent and reusable.', u'It comes in a plastic tube which serves as a holder for the Absorber and I would suggest you store it in there since the Absorber should be stored moist so it does not break down and stiffen.', u'The product really does absorb a lot of water and is the best car dryer I have ever had.', u'After you wash the car run the Absorber over the car and 90% of the water gets removed.', u'When the towel gets saturated, just wring it out and start drying again.', u'It cuts car drying time at least in half, maybe more, plus the effort to dry with this towel is less than with a standard towel or chamois.', u'If the car is in the sun or if you have hard water or if you are meticulous about your car, it may be a good thing to run a microfiber towel over the car after you use the Absorber to get the rest of the water off and to ensure no spots/streaks get  left behind.', u'When you are done, just wring most of the water out of the Absorber and roll it back into its plastic container for next time.', u'This is a great product for car drying or for cleaning up wet spills.', u'I highly recommended it for those purposes.', u'I am hesitant to recommend using it on your body since it sits in a moist, bacteria-friendly environment between uses - but as a car dryer it is terrific.', u'I comparison shop a lot before buying anything - hopefully you can benefit from my time investment and review.', u'For those of you who are wondering \"do I have to keep the tube forever?', u'\", the answer is \"no\".', u'I threw my tube away the first week I had it and three years later it still performs like a champ.', u'The chamois will dry out and become hard if left exposed, but once you wet it again, it becomes as absorbent and pliable as new.The other reviews are correct.', u'This thing holds an astounding amount of water for its size and weight and is excellent at streak free drying of automotive surfaces.', u'Once saturated with water, it wrings out very easily and it ready to pick more back up.', u'After three years mine has held up very well, though it is a bit discolored from the dirt it has picked up from my car over time.This is the only drying chamois most people will ever need.', u'Not sure what all the 1 star reviewers are doing wrong as these dry my cars dry streak and spot free.', u'You see some micro streaks when using this but they evaporate.', u'Using the same two for over 15 years stored in their containers.', u'No mold or anything... best drying material I ever used and I tried them all.', u'I have several of this, I use them for all sorts of things.', u\"They last for many years, I use them on job sites to keep cool, just dip it in cold water and instant cooling.We also use them for keeping the dogs cool as if they weren't already cool looking.DO NOT BUY ANY IMITATION This is the best!\", u'My wife was extremely pleased to find that this item is Made in Japan--both because she takes it as a sign of quality and because she\\'s Made in Japan herself.We\\'re also familiar with this kind of product in Japan, where it\\'s called a \"gum towel.', u'\"I bought two actually, one for her and one for me to use on my bicycles--thinking it would be something like a super absorbant chamois rather than a gum towel.', u\"It's certainly super absorbant, but doesn't have the chamois quality I would need to, say, polish my bike frames.\", u\"That is to say it's more sticky than soft, more like a piece of foam rubber or neoprene than a cloth.So if I just hosed down the bike while cleaning and wanted to get on with the next steps of polishing and relubing, this towel is a great way to dry the bike when it's neither hot nor dry enough of a day for the bike to dry out on it's own in a fair amount of time.It really draws the water out too, from every knook and cranny, so no need to use DW-40 before lubing my nice clean parts.My wife uses ours for everything from picking up spills to quickly drying wet clothing that can't go in the dryer.\", u\"If you wash a sweater for example, it's best to roll it up in the Absorber before laying it out to dry, as this will cut your drying time to at least half and make it less of a hazard that the sweater will get out of shape.We use my far more grungy one as you might use a wet vac.\", u\"It actually does a better job than a wet vac though.Add that I've used several gum towels in Japan, mostly for swimming, and this is by far the thickest one I've used--therefore more absorbant.\", u'And at 27\" x 17\" it\\'s big enough to be used as a bath towel without having to ring it out over and over again.BOTTOM LINE:I recommend this particular make and model over others simply based on the large size and the thickness of the towel.Don\\'t expect to use this to polish or dust, as the texture of the towel is far too sticky for that.I initially searched for the Sham-Wow on Amazon because I had seen it on TV, and still would like to try it out because it seems like it might be more chamois like--where you could wipe and polish with it.Overall, we\\'re thrilled with the quality, size, and how well this item works.', u'Absolutely 5 stars.', u'I just finished using this for the first time today.', u\"Lately I'd been using a flexible squeege to begin drying my car then follow up with a chamois.WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!\", u'Rarely does one come across an item that works exactly as advertized.', u'This one does!', u'Now I use the chamois for the tires and wheels and the Absorber for the car.', u'Unbelievable how much water that thing can suck up and hold!', u'Try it.', u\"You'll love it.\", u'I have used these for over 10 years as well as natural sheep skin chamois.', u'This works very well.', u\"If you wring it out (edges too) it doesn't streak, leave water behind, and works about as well as a natural chamois.\", u\"It will also last for years if left damp and stored in the plastic container, (nope don't dry it).\", u'Then why use a natural chamois?', u'Well for me there is something about the shine left behind with a natural chamois.', u\"I'm 69 years old and have used those since a teenager.\", u'Now that maybe just a memory lane thing since this works just fine.', u\"If you don't want to dry, and as I do stretch and soften a natural chamois after use, then get this.\", u'It works very well, plus I have never found anything synthetic, that works as well.', u\"(Believe me I've tried a lot different ones too.\", u'Haaa)  I do recommend it.', u'Hope this helps someone.', u\"This product is obviously manmade but is equal to or better than any 'natural' chamois I ever had.\", u\"It's just marvelous.\", u'I liked the absorber because it did not leave any streaks on my vehicle.', u'The material was sturdy and not flimsy.', u'I have had one of these for years and loved it.', u\"My wife didn't know what it was so she thought it was old and garbage.\", u'I love drying my Evo X with these.', u'They get all the water off and leave to streaks.', u\"Its a must have when detailing your car Works great for drying the car quickly and easily when its not hot enough out to do it quickly, and you don't wanna have to polish out all the water spots afterwords (Black car).\", u\"This thing absorbs so much water you won't believe it till you use it, and it just takes a beating and keeps on going.\", u\"When I first used it I was afraid I was gonna rip it by twisting the water out too hard, nope, just keep wringing it out until its dry and continue on.A little secret to using it, at least I've found it to work better this way.\", u'When drying the car, lay the Absorber out flat (unfold it across the surface) and then grasp it at one end at each corner and drag it slowly across the car allowing it to absorb all the water it comes into contact with.', u'This works especially well on horizontal surfaces, but still good enough on the vertical ones as well.', u\"This practice also helps to prevent scratching of the surface when small particles get trapped between the chamois and the paint surface and then your hand comes and pushes it right into the paint.Little warning, when it comes, don't smell it.\", u'Mine reeeeekkkkkeeedddd!', u'But I just rinsed it out and the smell went away.', u\"Yes it is true that you can put it right back into the tube wet (Well to get it back in the tube, you must, because you can't roll it once it dry), but I like to leave the top off of the tube to allow air in there to dry it out before I close it up and that musty gross smell comes back.Long story short: Get it, you won't be disappointed.\", u\"I've been using these things for several years and I buy a new one about every year or so.\", u'The Absorber is PVA, so it needs to stay a little wet because it gets very stiff when dry.', u\"Once you get used to it and how it works, it's great.\", u'There are a lot of PVA drying towels out there that are cheaper, but believe me, this one is superior in thickness and quality.', u\"I bought a cheap, generic one at Wal-Mart and it started tearing apart within a couple days.I use mine to wipe down just about anything and everything you'd use a normal towel for.\", u\"It won't get something as immediately dry to the touch as a towel since it is slightly damp to start with, but evaporation quickly takes care of the rest.\", u'The main advantage over a towel is that it works like both a towel and a sponge, depending on how wet it is.', u\"It's nice and cool to the touch so it doubles as a cooling cloth in the summer heat.\", u'When it gets too wet, you just wring it out.', u\"When it gets a little dirty, soak it in a little soap and water and wring it out or throw it in the washer (just make sure you don't put it in the dryer, it comes out of the washer slightly damp, just like it should be stored).\", u'Every few washes, I recommend using some bleach in the wash or soaking it with some bleach to help keep it like new.', u\"I was prepared to write a &#34;sham-why&#34; review because initially this thing acted like a sheet of nonabsorbent rubber, but once it started soaking water it seemed to 'open up' and began working pretty well.\", u'It wrings out easily and leaves no lint, which is pretty rad,  because the old bath towels I was using before made my car fuzzy.', u\"I've never used a synthetic chamois before, so I'm not sure how well they are supposed to work.\", u\"I washed my minivan the other day; and I'd say it took one swipe on a panel, squeeze dry, then a second swipe to completely dry the panel.\", u'The Absorber is a nice, large size.', u'It dries my car better than old bath towels, and it left no water spots.', u\"I'm very happy with its performance and would buy it again.\", u'Pros:- works better than chamois in absorbing water.- does not produce streaks when drying cars  - Spot free!- I cut it to half and quarter sizes - makes it great for the kitchen tops, sink and bathroom- works great for kitchen spills- available almost everywhere- cheaper than chamoisCons:-You have to store it moist in the canister or it will dry stiff as a cardboard.', u'(Dip it on water and it is good to go again).-Storing it moist promotes growth of bacteria and micro-organism.', u'Forget about using it on your body as a towel or drying your plates, pots and utensils.', u'Awesome.', u'Just used this for the first time earlier today.', u\"I've owned a natural chamois but haven't used it in years so I threw it away.\", u'This works great.', u'Washed my car and then used a Water Blade on it (def another recommended product) and then used this on all the corners and tight spaces.', u'Soaks the water up very well, rings out a lot of the water and stores &#34;damp&#34; which means little to not maintenance to maintain.', u'Covers a lot of area too I was surprised once I unfolded it just how big it was.', u'This thing will hold a lot of water.', u'just be sure to keep it moist inside the original tube.', u'I will buy more of these.', u'Just need to watch the price and buy low.', u'I have a black car so i need to dry it to avoid spots.', u'this works great.', u'holds a lot of water and takes me few min to dry whole car.', u'I find it much easier to use this chamois over a towel while drying a car.', u'The absorber works well with soaking up water then with a quick squeeze your back at drying.', u'The chamois does not leave cloth and lint on your car like towels and old shirts.', u'I also use a damp chamois to wipe down the interior dash and seats of my vehicle, which works very well.', u'I would also recommend a soft water blade to use first after rinsing your vehicle to do the large areas and windows...then go back over it with the chamois.', u'It will cut your car drying time in half and work x2 as good.', u'You are supposed to keep the chamois damp so when I am done I just put it back in the case and it will stay damp until my cars next wash.', u'It is supposed to extend the life of the chamois.', u'This dries my car very well and stops water spots from forming.', u'Keep all those sham wows.', u'I have used Absorber Chamois for years, much better than natural ones or any other brands.', u'I purchased this cloth with the intent of drying my car after I have washed it.', u'I have very hard water and when I want my car to look nice I have to dry it or I get little hard water spots all over the place.Drying my car with \"The Absorber\" does solve that problem and it does absorb quite a lot of water.', u'It squeezes out easy and stores quite well in the container it comes in.', u'I have used it a number of times and am generally happy with it.I should mention it is does not perfectly get every last bit of water.', u'But it dries to the point where the residual water evaporates in a minute or so.', u\"I consider that pretty good and my goal of not having water spots is met so I'm a happy camper.\", u'I would buy another one if I needed it :) this has been a must have in the detailing word.', u'This holds SO much water and comes with a nice container to stow it away.', u'Quality and works excellent, does not scratch.', u'NEVER use another brand!']\n"

true, hard-core offroaders, but I must say I'm very impressed with the materials quality and the quality of the design of this Smittybilt hitch.\", u'I wanted a removable hitch and liked the price of the Smittybilt.', u'In this case, I must say that I came from the price....but left impressed with the quality.', u'Well done Smitty!', u'I had a bunch of nasty thorny bushes that I could not even get close to that I lassoed with a slip not then yanked the crap out of them with the Smittybilt 29312b attached to my Toyota FJ.', u'I then pulled out some old stumps and some huge fence and fence posts on the side of a hill that were buried in concrete by some crazy person who had the property before me.', u'No other method I could think of would have the possibility of working and the pro guys with bobcats estimate was over a thousand dollars.', u'I even had all four wheels of the FJ spinning on a concrete drive yanking and that is some kind of force.All in all I am impressed with this Hitch, and recommend it.', u'this is really a cool looking addition to any tow hitch assembly.the good thing about this is that it is functional as well.', u'Reading through some of the reviews leads me to think there may have been a change in manfacturing processes.', u'The unit I received is perfect.', u'Fits perfect, and ,measures out perfectly.', u'I had no problem installing it.', u'It weighs a lot, and had no problem holding up when in use.', u'I wish it came with a pin, but other than that I can only say very positive things about this receiver.', u'Item was back ordered and took a while

loose but it's stored in a toolbox anyway.\", u\"I purchased a Curt 21510 hitch pin and clip with the receiver shackle, the combination works great and I'm satisfied with both.\", u'This product is

paint and I could see it was very thick.', u'I used a bench grinder to remove the paint and smooth out some of the rough spots (took maybe 5 minutes).', u'I then re-painted it and it fits like a

sleek black.', u'Great product that feels very solid.', u'This thing is solid!', u'It is not a bent piece of steel like some other ones, it is a solid cast piece and is very heavy.', u\"I've towed

very thick paint that may interfere with fit inside some 2&#34; receivers which could be a disappointment/surprise.', u'We used it on another vehicle than the intended one, with a more forgiving

pin.\", u'Very secure.', u'No noise or rattling noted, and I have it on the truck at all times for recovery purposes (helping me or others get out).', u'I continue to be impressed by the quality of

hardware.', u'Very solid and dependable, BUT.....it rattles in my receiver hitch.', u'I solved that by wrapping duct tape around the body before inserting it into the receiver hitch.', u\"I love it...!Make sure you lock it in....these babies get stolen around where I live.I'm very happy with it.\", u'In fact, I ordered another....

controller that does it's job the best.\", u'Buy the Tekonsha P3.', u'I spent several weeks trying to decide if i wanted to invest in a brake controller for our new-to-us travel trailer.', u'Since i grew up on a farm, trailers are nothing new to me but brake controllers are.', u\"I am pulling a 26' bumper-to-bumper trailer with a 2006 Yukon Denali XL and the 400 miles that I have pulled it have been without issue.\", u\"However, there was one time that I wished that I had more stopping power and the trailer seemed like a load for the Yukon's brakes,so I started researching brake controllers.\", u'First I looked at a middle of the road option from Wal-Mart, but then I ran across this one for $40 more.', u'Somewhere in the reviews a person mentions the cost of not having one, and he/she could not be more right.', u'$20,000.00 SUV, $4,000.00 trailer (weekend warriors), and my priceless family and family pets....and I had to think for two weeks about spending $100.00??', u'?I ordered the brake controller and the proper wiring harness from Amazon and had it in two days thanks to my prime membership.', u'With the $10 wiring harness for the Yukon, I was able to install the controller in 20 minutes...no joke.', u'No splicing...no fuse manipulation..no electrical tape...just plug-n-play.', u'Also to my surprise the Yukon had two pre-drilled holes in metal directly under the steering column that fit the brake controller mounting bracket perfectly.', u'Now for a test run.I hooked the trailer up and the controller immediately detected it so I took off slowly down my driveway.', u'While I did look at the brakes when I purchased the trailer (I am pretty sure the previous owner never used them), I had no way of testing the overall system so my first test was to see if the trailer brake system actually worked.', u'It did.', u'In fact, the boost was set on 2 and the wheels locked up with little effort.', u'I tried no boost and then settled on boost 1.', u'I can see where the options of no boost, boost 1, and boost 2 will be nice when going through the mountains.Anyhow, the final test, I took off down the road and not 3 miles from house some yahoo decided to pass me on a two lane road at the crest of a hill and forced me into a situation where I had to put the brakes to the floor.', u'In that instant the trailer brakes locked and stopped the Yukon, not the other way around, and every ounce of buyers remorse was gone just as quickly.Give yourself some piece of mind while saving the brakes on your towing rig.', u'Buy it and grab a wiring harness while you are at it.', u'The P3 arrived exactly as described but my order was \"lost\" for 6 days between the printing of the shipping label and pick up by the P.O.', u'No explaination was given when I contacted the company.', u\"Other than that I'm very satisfied with both the P3's function and performance.\", u'My only problem was mounting the unit in my 2012 Tundra.', u'The plug in adaptor which I also purchased, mated up perfectly with the pre wired harness, included with Toyota\\'s optional \"tow package\".', u'Older Tundras and some of the 2012 models came with a pre wired harness about 1 foot long, but my 2012 was delivered with the new and improved shorter version, (something to do with safety) and is only about 3 inches long.', u'The longer harness, coupled with the plug in adaptor, allowed mounting the P3 to the right side of the steering wheel by the center console, out of the way.', u'Unfortunately, some later model Tundras, like mine, have the 3\" pre wire harness, which restricts mounting the P3 just to the right of the hood release and directly above the emergency brake pedal.', u\"If I'm not extreemly careful, with my size 13 shoe, I inadvertently step on the face of the P3 when applying the emergency brake.\", u'If you leave the 2 mounting screws a little loose you can tilt the P3 up which gives you a little more clearance between the E brake and the P3 and all is good.. My truck came with a cheap brake controller that worked.', u'Decided I wanted something a bit better and purchased this one.Wow!', u'This makes a night and day difference.', u'Stopping with the trailer is so much smoother with this brake controller.I never really thought it would make such a huge difference.Still need to tune it in per instructions, but I am very satisfied already.', u'This is my first travel trailer and exposure to an electronic brake control.', u'The dealer installed an inexpensive reese controller but the slide movement was too sensitive.', u'I bought this and set it up.', u'I would recommend to anyone first setting up to have your trailer brakes adjusted, then follow the manual.', u'After adjustment of the brakes I only needed a boost to 2, down from 3 prior to the adjustment.The reason I chose 4 out of 5 stars is that I am not sure if I have this set up correctly or it is an anomaly.What I mean is that if I start out braking hard I can feel the trailer brakes kick in and get a good stop, but it is not immediate.', u'If I get off the brakes and coast for 5+ seconds and brake again it can be a bit sensitive and be too much and can jerk the TV around.', u'if I gradually stop I do not feel the brakes as much.', u'I do realize that the faster I travel the more boost I need.', u'My trailer is 146% heavier than the tow vehicle.', u'It seems that my initial braking sets the sensitivity.', u'As I slow down for city traffic or campground speeds I only need boost 1.', u'First, this is a great unit and rock solid at brake control.', u'I upgraded from a Tekonsha Prodigy.', u\"It's Simple!\", u\"Just removed the older unit (Prodigy) from it's existing bracket, unplugged the existing wiring plug, plugged in the P-3.\", u'I slid the P-3 into the old bracket and inserted the 2 screws.', u\"It's installed.Then I just adjusted the P-3 per the included operating instructions.\", u'It could not have been simpler.Starting from scratch?', u'About an hours work and the instructions are all there.', u'Most newer trucks come with a trailer harness for a controller.', u'My 06 Chev 2500HD did.', u'However there are instructions for installing it without a dealer supplied harness as well.Highly recommend this unit vs. others if mounted at eye level.', u'(see \"Update Aiain).Update:  This is a great unit.', u'BUT, other than an LCD screen to provide additional info for the user, the ability to control the braking action is no better/ no worse than the Prodigy I replaced.Update again:  The LCD screen is impossible to read if the unit is mounted low on the dashboard area and/or if you wearing polarized sun glasses.', u'I switched back to the LED unit which is far easier to see and read.DOWNGRADED TO 4 Stars!', u'I used this controller to replace the horrible factory dodge controller in my 2010 ram 2500.', u'This controller is worlds ahead of the factory controller in terms of features and available settings.', u'If you are hauling a large trailer it is a must have.', u'The boost function is a great feature that applies the trailer brakes ahead of the truck brakes.', u'You can set boost to 3 levels to meet your desired brake feel.', u'My fiver weighs around 2500lbs more than my truck and between this controller and the exhaust brake stopping is effortless.', u'I have installed and used other brake controllers, but this one is hands down the best one I have used yet.', u'It is a little bit more expensive but the adaptive braking makes towing a trailer or various trailers (It has memory for multiple trailer setups) so much nicer and smoother, as it knows how much braking force to apply and is easily adjustable.', u'Installation was a breeze after purchasing the appropriate wiring and a resettable circuit breaker to finish out the installation (none of my vehicles have come equipped as prewired for an electric brake controller).Questions?', u'C23flyboy@msn.com Two things I really like about this controller.First it has storable settings for different trailers.', u'One of the most time consuming things you can do is adjust trailer brakes.', u'With my old controller, ever time I changed trailers, I had to re-adjust the settings.', u'Big Pain!', u'With this one, just adjust and store the settings for each trailer.', u'So much easier!', u'Just hook up the trailer, select it from memory and go!', u'Also works great if you have multiple drivers who prefer different brake settings.Secondly, I really like the different colors you can chose for the display.', u'You can change it for different lighting and eyes.', u'This is handy also because this controller has built in on screen diagnostics!', u'It makes troubleshooting a brake problem while your in Timbuktu so much easier.Oh and I guess I have a third one too...', u'I like the multiple buttons that let me select the main functions without going into some sub-menu maze.It also can be mounted at any front to rear dash angle unlike many others.', u'It comes with two mounting brackets, one for permanent mount and one for quick disconnect so it can be easily moved from one vehicle to another and back again.Oh yes, and their patented brake boost function is just amazing!', u'Stops the trailer much quicker with a great feel.Guess I really like it.', u\"I'll never go back to the others...\"]\n"

      "[u'I found this product work as advertised, however it dried very quickly and was difficult to remove at times.', u'I applied with Porter Cable polisher and it helps to mark your pad so you knows its spinning.', u'I had better results with the M205 for swirl mark removal then the M105 and it was easier to apply and remove.', u'I purchased this after reading rave reviews in several different forums and websites.', u'The reviewers were right.', u'This product does exactly what it is intended to do.', u\"It's perfect for compounding a vehicle in need of paint correction.\", u'If you have swirls and light scratches, then this is what you use if you want to eliminate them.', u'For those that use off the shelf waxes at the auto store (as I used to do), they only temporarily cover up the swirls, they do not remove them.', u\"I spent close to 30 hours researching how to properly do paint correction and this was one of the most hyped compounding polishes out there from the pros.I started by using a clay bar and clay lubricant on my car to remove the contaminants in the clear coat that even the M105 won't pull out.\", u\"Then after washing the car, I used a Porter Cable DA polisher (also purchased here on Amazon) to compound the car's surface with the appropriate pad (typically orange).\", u'I worked in 2 foot by 2 foot sections and used cross hatch patterns to assure even coverage.', u\"This really brought out a lot of shine and this isn't even the polishing stage yet!\", u\"It wouldn't pull out one heavier scratch that I have, but it made quick work of the smaller scratches and completely removed the swirl marks.\", u'Keep in mind that this is an abrasive.', u\"You don't want to use this every time you detail your car because it removes a very small amount of the clear coat.\", u\"You should hopefully only have to use this once to correct the issues then you can maintain the paint from there.I then used Meguiar's M205 to polish the car, again using the DA but this time with a white pad designed for polishing This is what brings out the shine!\", u\"It's like wood working.. you start with a rougher 120 grit to get the majority of the roughness out, then move up to a less aggressive 240 grit sandpaper to smooth it out even more.\", u'These products are simply liquid sandpaper - one has more grit and the other has less.', u\"One does the dirty work, the other finishes it offFor what it's worth, I then followed up the polishing with 2 coats of sealant and 2 coats of Carnuba wax.\", u\"The before and after is simply amazing and that's saying a lot because the car I did all of this on is yellow, not a color known for high gloss and reflection quality like you see on darker carsHighly recommended!\", u'Worked great for a nice finish polish.', u'Removed all the swirls nicely with a combo using the m205 as my finish.', u'I like the way the 205 worked the paint better than the 105.', u'Im new to the polish game so maybe I was using to much or little.', u'Overall a great combo As I worked with this product more and more I became better at using it.', u'At first I was a little hesitant to really work it in.', u'I started slow and got better and better results.', u'Be patient and measure the results a little at a time.', u'Good luck I used the 105 compound with my Porter-Cable 7424XP 6-Inch Variable-Speed Polisher to remove surface blemishes and scratches - the finish is amazing - take your time and work on small areas before moving on and you will be rewarded with a fantastic result!', u\"I have been using Meguiar's products for many years and when I learned about M105 Compound and used it I found it worked great.\", u'I have had better luck with severe oxidation with the maroon cutting pad and yellow pad with mild to moderate oxidation on the DA polisher.', u'I have been detailing/repairing paint finishes in cars as a side business for over 20 years and this product is the best by far that I have ever used.', u'M105 should be used with the understanding that M205 is to be used next.', u'Anytime you compound you must always polish too.', u\"Then I recommend using Meg's 2.0 sealant.\", u\"Make sure you use the appropriate foam pads when applying these products but once finished you will be shocked at the imperfections that these products will remove in your car's finish.\", u'Do not plan to do all 3 steps in the same day (unless your absolutely mad), to do it properly try and do this in a friends Garage or in your own over a few days.', u'Once finished the car will look like a mirror!', u\"Also check around for pricing on this stuff often Amazon isn't the lowest.\", u'I love this stuff!', u'Great product I will always have a bottle of this in my arsenal!', u'Cuts fast and finishes nicely.', u'I cant believe how fast this cuts.', u\"Was so shiny I didn't think I needed the 205 but I did it anyway.What a shine.\", u'Glad I jumped from 3M to this.', u'Saved so much time.', u'Worked well removing a lot of scratches and using with the Porter-Cable buffer it did not take so long.', u'The price seemed to be the best compared with other online shops.', u'I used this on an 20 year old paint and it worked wonderfully!', u'It took all the haze and most scratches out.', u\"I followed this with Meguiar's M205.\", u'Great cutting ability ...', u'It competes with menzerna fg400  it all depends on the paint to see which one gives better results.', u'However I do see more of a haze with this than the fg 400 but as long as you follow with a good polish no problems ...', u'I had a few light scratches on my car (04 silver Maxima), not totally sure if I even needed to compound but I ran with it.', u'After clay barring, I followed with the M105.', u\"It took care of some light scratches, maybe a higher cutting pad would have taken care of the deeper imperfections, but I rather start lighter then too heavy.I was kind of apprehensive as most with using compound, as I'm sure most are (newbie) but it applied very easy and wiped off even easier.\", u'Remember to keep the area your working small 2x2 and keep it moving..FYI, I clay barred, compounded, polished, and waxed (6hrs) and my car looks great!!', u'Using a HF DA polisher with this compound I take years of neglect out of peoples paint.', u'One of the best over the counter compounds, and does a great job.', u'Just be aware that this is a fairly aggressive compound designed to take down large scratches, if you just have light swirling jump straight to the M205.', u\"I've always loved Meguiars products and I am quickly becoming accustomed to using there products exclusively throughout the automotive field.\", u'I used this product during the final colorsanding phases of a replacement fender job that I did on my own vehicle and absoloutely loved the results.', u'Let it be known that you should still follow this up with M205 which is more of a final finishing polish that will take out anything this product leaves behind (which is minimal when done correctly).', u'I give this product an excellent rating strictly because prior to using this product I used Turtle Wax brand polishing compound which was considerably more abrasive and left very hard to polish out swirls after its usage on a hood job.', u'I finished the hood seperately and just wound up buffing the heck out of it with my buffer and Meguiars ultimate polishing compound which is also a good product but a little too fine in my opinion to take out wet sanding marks considerably.', u'This product does the job quickly, cleanly, and probably most importantly allows for the least amount of time/work that you must do yourself.', u'As with any job, especially in high in/out environments like a shop you will definitely want to make the most out of the time you have and this would be the product for you.', u'Never again will I even consider turtle wax polishing compound in the final stages of color sanding.', u\"It's not worth the risk to have to reset which will be even more labor intensive, time consuming, and probably most importantly a much bigger hit in the wallet.\", u'For the average weekend warrior/beginner this is a great way to save yourself from making mistakes.', u'Tips:  I use this with the Meguiars 7000 ultra cutting foam (reddish) pad.', u'I follow it up with the Meguiars 8000 (yellowish) foam pad and the meguiars m205.', u'As with any body work I do I do a gentle had buff follow up with the 205 as well, (especially important for black cars).', u\"Results are outstanding as long as you have a little patience and TLC you won't go wrong.\", u\"Keep your buffer steady, level and slow to moderate speed... You don't want the thing sanding, you want it buffing!\", u'this was super easy to use, i applyed light to moderate pressure using very little product, using a PC xp and hexlogic orang cutting pad, 5-6 passes on high damaged areas, and it will really remove defects, followed by M205, swirls free mirror glaze is achived.', u'Great product and performs as advertised.', u'Easy to put on and take off of the buffer machine.', u'I highly recommend this product for and outstanding shine for your paint.', u'This product was recommended by a neighbor for the final &#34;sanding&#34; of a new lacquer finish.', u'I had never used before, and what a pleasant surprise.', u'It made the finish very smooth, and once the wax was applied, it is perfect.', u\"It remove all of the swirls and light scratches from my truck but I had to deal with dusting until I figured out how to prevent it.Meguiar's has some of the best products on the market , this is one of them This compound has its ups and downs, but is ultimately my go to product when I need a heavy compound with amazing correction capabilities.\", u'It is able to remove severe defects, even wet sanding marks when paired with the proper pads and machine.', u'This compound also finishes down very nicely, and in some instances is not required to follow up with a finishing polish.', u'This greatly reduces time spent correcting vehicles.', u\"Another great product from Meguiar's!\"]\n"

      "[u'Great product!', u'Excellent quality!', u'I bought the Scan Gauge II for one purpose and that was for the transmission temperature gauge for my Silverado.', u'The other option was to replace the dash cluster with one that had the transmission temperature gauge and the Scan Gauge was cheaper by a long shot.', u\"Besides having the gauge I was wanting now I've got several others to like the actual water temperature plus the ability to identify and clear engine codes.\", u\"I've had it on my truck long enough now to say that this is a good product.\", u\"It works like it's supposed to and unlike a lot of the blue tooth units that transmit the info to the smart phone the Scan Gauge doesn't have to be reprogrammed every time it's turned on from the last time you used it.\", u'The Scan Gauge comes back on with the same display every time.', u'I have used the older version of this gauge, which I found to be an excellent buy.', u'This version has some more useful functions.', u'The price is unbeatable.', u'I mounted it on top of my steering column using Velcro tape.', u\"The SG does all it's advertisd to do very well.\", u'Using the programable functions requires some effort.', u\"I'm glad I have it but haven't gone much beyond basics.\", u'It works and the support staff at Linear Logic are helpful if you have any issues.', u\"My local shop suspected that I have a bad O2 sensor that wasn't being flagged by the on-board computer.\", u'With the ScanGauge, I programmed in codes for fuel trim, O2 sensors, and air/fuel ratio and can see that it all looks ok.', u'Saved $100+ in diagnosis charges and I can monitor the readings as I drive.', u'simple, logic and easy to use.', u'a useful tool to read data from the computer on your car, read codes and diagnose by yourself with a little search on the web.', u'you can take note on the different indicators to know the \"normal parameters\" of your car, and notice when any change occurs and an error code lights your CEL, that way it will be easier to tell what went wrong.The only con is that there isnt any cable or software to connect to a PC or laptop- that would make it a better tool.', u'Well this thing is as easy as tying your shoes laces.', u'Plug in two wires, let it sit there for a few seconds and BOOM, it works.', u'I still have to wait to fill up so I can calibrate that portion but everything else is good to go.', u'This thing tells you everything you want to know about your vehicle components and more.', u'The X-gauge is an awesome addition to an already great product.', u'You can go the their website and review how to program the X-guages that are compatible with your specific vehicle.', u\"Don't wait like I did.\", u'Order this NOW!!!', u'As usual Amazon came through with the shipping.', u\"If you don't want take my word for it, just look at the 300+ people that purchased it before me.\", u'Now I know exactly what my actual and average gas mileage is for my truck.', u'The installation of the SG2 is simple: attach the OBD2 connector to the DLC port and attach the RJ-45 jack to the SG2 unit.', u'Routing the cable is really up to the operator.', u\"I chose to do it in a crude manner because I don't plan to make it a permanent addition to the car.\", u'I zip tied the cable to my HVAC vents and anchored it to the empty traction control hole behind the glove box.I used 1 of the provided velcro kits to affix the SG2 to the top of my steering column so that it is right below the instrument panel.', u'It actually blocks my view of the shift indicator array, although I can still see it clearly if I lean forward.The update rate set at FAST is still rather slow and that is to be expected with the outdated OBD-II network.', u'The \"fastest\" aftermarket scan tool that I have seen is SCT\\'s Live Link for Ford / GM / Chryslers.', u\"If you want anything faster, you are going to have to borrow an OEM's scan tool system.The X-Gauge interface is a bit cumbersome since you are restricted to using 2 buttons to enter alphanumeric characters while if you pause for anything more than 10-15 seconds, the SG2 shuts down.\", u'According to Linear Logic, they are working on an updated SG2 with datalogging features so hopefully they incorporate a PC interface to speed up programming and setup times.I have it set to monitor instantaneous MPG, RPM, Vehicle Speed, and a gauge that I frequently switch depending on my mood.', u'I am monitoring the torque converter slip ratio.', u'Whenever it reads below 1.00, it means the torque converter is \"slipping\".', u'Above 1.00 means the output side of the converter is spinning faster than the input side and theoretically it could just mean engine braking with some torque converter slip.', u'You can program custom X-Gauges to monitor gross engine horsepower or torque input at the transmission.I had previously used a Garmin Forerunner 101 to check my GPS vehicle speed and compared it to my speedometer readout (2000 Ford Crown Vic with mechanical speedometer).', u'It revealed that my GPS speed was about 2-3 mph slower than the speedometer indicated speed.', u\"The SG2's vehicle speed readout (from the Vehicle Speed Sensor PID in the OBD-2 system) is approximately 2-3 mph slower than the speedometer reading and I am assuming this is the same readout as my GPS (I didn't get a chance to verify this yet).Some of the gauges I like to monitor are Coolant Temperature, Intake Air Temperature, Transmission Fluid Temperature (XGauge), Torque Converter Slip Ratio (XGauge), Gross Horsepower (XGauge), RPM, Vehicle Speed, and MPG.I still haven't been able to figure out how to work the trip computer properly to display averaged fuel economy.\", u'The instantaneous MPG is more important to me because I want to see if anything is not working right on long cruises.', u'I have often wondered if the torque converter was locking properly when I use cruise control or when cruising on the highway.The data collection stability is impressive.', u\"I never ran into many problems with Car Code or SCT's Live Link, but SG2 is just more convenient and compact.\", u'The backlight colors are interesting as they allow you to choose 4 different values of each RGB component (or 64 possible combinations).', u\"I have it set to R=3, B=0, G=0 so that it resembles Pontiac's interior lighting (I drive a Ford).My only real complaint is that there's not a better way of attaching the SG2 to the car.\", u'A suction cup mount for the windshield would come in handy since I could mount it near my line of sight without relying on adhesive-backed velcro.', u'The interface is quite intuitive but I would have liked a way to program the X-gauge more easily, like via a PC interface.Bottom line: The SG2 is a great deal if you are interested in data readouts for your car.', u'There are cheaper ways of pulling DTC codes, so the only real usefulness of SG2 is the \"realtime\" PID monitoring and the trip computer for cars that do not have such devices.', u'If you know someone who is a bona fide gearhead and drives a car made in 1996 or newer, they may appreciate the SG2 as a gift.UPDATE:While the ScanGauge II provided a useful feature for cars without trip computers or onboard monitoring for various PIDs, I have noticed that it began to malfunction more frequently.', u'The gauge readouts began to \"flicker\" between PIDs.', u'For example, monitoring IGNition, the IGN began to switch rapidly between HPR.', u'Just recently, the entire ScanGauge II shutdown while I was driving.', u'It would refuse to reconnect with the OBD2 network.', u'When it did find a connection, a lot of the text was garbled and it lost all of my trip data except for the total mileage.', u'My car normally maxes out on 300 miles per tank of gasoline, so I was bewildered when the SG2 said I drove over 4000 miles.', u'Other SG2 readers have reported similar quirks, albeit not as serious as the self shutdown and data corruption that I experienced.Many newer cars already have features built-into the car.', u'The Pontiac G8, and Nissan GT-R are two examples of cars that have very developed \"trip computers\" while many other modern vehicles like the Pontiac G6, have trip computers that can monitor most of the fuel-related data.', u'Great product!!', u'I\\'m going to make it pay for itself by checking and clearing the \"Check Engine\" lights for my friends (for a fee).', u'Down side is that installation brackets are not included or even offered.', u'The manufacturer expects everybody to use hook and loop tape.', u'This thing does it all.', u'It was a good investment for me.', u'I ended up buying a second cable so I can easily swap between my two vehicles.', u'(I have the cables hidden and snaked up through the dash so it looks clean.)', u\"I can't say enough good things about the ScanGauge!!\", u'XGauge coding has allowed me to see tons of data about the operation of the hybrid system in each of our cars.', u'I enjoy all the extra data and the ScanGauge has helped me to understand the powertrain design & operation way better than I could have ever figured out from just watching the dash screens.', u'ok, if you read the reviews, you will see lots of \"oh the cord is so long, it has to run by the brake pedals, its not 100% accurate\" blah blah wah wah.', u'This device simply reads and displays what the vehicles computer is showing.', u'is anything 100% accurate?', u'hardly.', u'but it does a good job.', u'for the people who say its not helping my mpg, are u kidding?', u'this device does not have anything to do with CONTROLLING your mpgs, your FOOT does!', u'the only way this helps is as a reminder that if you drive like an idiot, u use more gas.', u'if u need a computer to tell u that, dont drive!', u'yes the cord routes by the pedals, thats where OBD ports are.', u'not everything in the world can be bluetooth, deal with it.', u'use a little common sense and route the cord.', u'this thing is handy, and works as advertised.', u'only reason im taking a star away, is that it is a little expensive for what it is, however, with my luck, now that ive bought it, the price will drop.', u'overall a great gadget, that can be saved and used on any future vehicles i may buy.EDIT/UPDATE:  after using the gauge a few different ways now, ive found the average mpg very helpful.', u'it really makes you realize the best way to increase mpg.', u'i thought before if i grandma the pedal always it wud help, takes more than that.', u'We have a 2008 Prius and a 2005 4Runner.', u'The Prius, with its cluster of gauges, has taught us how to drive more economically.', u'I hoped adding the ScanGauge II to the 4Runner, a gas hog, would help reduce our gas consumption.', u\"While it is full of interesting information I'd have to say it has not helped at all with increasing our mileage.\", u\"What has helped is what we learned from the Prius.I like the gauge and all of it's options.\", u\"I keep it and wouldn't want to be without it because it is novel.\", u'It is very expensive though.', u'There are cables and apps for Android and iOS that will allow you to do the same thing but with color graphics which I think might be a cheaper and better option these days.Update May 13, 2013In hindsight I realize this ScanGauge II has saved me a lot of gas money.', u'The way it did that was showing me how very expensive it is for me to drive the 2005 Toyota 4Runner which gets between 12 mpg and 20 mpg.', u'I sometimes have had the ScanGauge II display Cost which shows in real time what it is costing me to drive minute by minute.', u\"Consequently we leave the 4Runner parked and covered from the sun for long periods, usually about a week at a time, while we drive the Prius everywhere.It always shocks me when I fill the 4Runner and put in 15 gallons or so into the 24 gallon tank which costs me about $60 and I've only driven about 200 miles.\", u'Then I compare that to the Prius in which we regularly get about 48 mpg and put in about 6 gallons having driven about 288 miles for a cost of about $24.So in the long run this ScanGauge II has paid for itself, not by teaching me any ways to save gas while driving the 4Runner, but rather by not driving it.', u'I found a Ford 6.0L diesel priced so low I couldn\\'t pass, and, I knew beforehand it\\'d require certain upgrades to instill natural diesel longevity and I needed a tool to help - enter Scangauge II.Scangauge II has features beyond a simple scan tool, eg Trip Computer (Miles per Gallon; Tank-to-Empty; Cost per Trip), Horsepower, -Mile Time, 0-60mph WOTs, Stopping Distance and others...Neat features but not reason I purchased...Digital Gauges (reason): the Mfr refers to this feature as \"X-Gauge\"- Screen displays four real-time On-board diagnostics Parameter Identifications (OBDII PIDs) of user choosing- PIDs displayed can be changed via pressing adjacent buttons- Performance Data (MPG, Qtr Mile Time etc) may be displayed together/alongside PIDs- Displays vehicle mfr generic PIDs automatically (gasoline engine)- Displays diesel mfr PIDs (ie EOT, ICT, IPR etc) after user creates an \\'x-gauge\\' by input data from Scangauge websiteWith basic knowledge and study I use this gadget to my advantage, I mean either repair vehicle myself, or, know what\\'s wrong (exactly what\\'s broken) beforehand, to preclude somename repair shop ripping me off - it\\'s way too common.I think it comes ready to troubleshoot gasoline engines, in general, yet I\\'d to enter math data (avail on website) manually for it to sense and display PIDs unique to diesel.After several days of study/application, my opinion is this tool will help diagnose with near certainty, components which have failed and components in early stage of failure.', u\"Its ability to depict four PIDs simultaneously in real-time allows comparison between what related PIDs reflect per desired and actual.Also note I found most big name Tuners boasting scan ability do not monitor/depict many key PIDs as Scangauge, a huge shortcoming for tuner price.Simply put, the Scangauge II is much more than an OBDII code reader and, it'll be difficult/near impossible to find an item offering same diagnostic capabilities for both gas and diesel engines at price.Update Jan 2014: I've purchased another for my Boy's pickup with a 7.3L.\", u\"We both have SCT Livewire 9600 Tuners but due to Livewire 9600's monitoring limitations we have Scangauges connected full time to monitor key PIDs.Kyle We bought this for our RV (2008 Mercedes Sprinter chassis) and it works great.\", u'I can see how many miles are left until an empty tank, watch the mpg, monitor engine temp, and lots of other things.', u'Be sure to read the manual for how to calibrate your mileage readings.', u'We mounted the ScanGauge on our dashboard using the provided velcro strips.', u'That approach was okay, but I would like to find a sturdier way to mount it.', u\"If you're handy, you can mount it on your dash and run the cable through the insides to get to the OBDII port.\", u'You have the option of having the cable connected to the ScanGauage either on the right side or out the back.', u'No additional electrical source is needed, since the OBD port is powered.', u'I have installed a transmission cooler in my FJ Cruiser and use this scan tool/gauge to monitor the transmission temperatures in the pan and at the converter control valve sensor.', u'Having the rig set up for towing, this product is a very valuable asset, plus you can watch various other parameters and sensor reading, MPG`s, etc etc and use it also as a scan tool...Excellent product!', u'I came to know about this tool when I was browsing the web for finding the details how to look for Hybrid Battery temperature on my recently acquired used 2006 Ford Escape Hybrid.', u'The forum suggested to their members thatScanGauge IIwould be the ideal choice to monitor the Motor Electronics Coolant Temp (MeC) and HV Battery temperature (Traction Battery Temp).I am pleased to inform that this tool can be configured with Ford Specific XGauges (See comments) to achieve that feat pretty easily.', u'Ford Escape Hybrid (With Navigation) does have host of other real-time display like HV battery SOC real-time MPG on the dash but FORD hides most of the stuff from user which are needed to troubleshoot common check engine light errors and in my case why my FORD escape Hybrid sometimes decides not to turn off the Internal combustion engine (ICE) and keeps running the Radiator FANs when it should not.', u'It baffled me for couple of weeks and led me to investigate the issue further.After setting this tool up and monitoring it for several days I could see a pattern that there are two main reason why the ICE would not shut down at idle or at a stop light.', u\"They were primarily due to 'over-temp' condition of the Motor Electronics Coolant temperature caused by a weak MCE coolant pump in conjunction with the HV battery Traction battery temperature.Replacing the nearly failed original 2006 Motor electronics Coolant Pump at 98,XXX miles (FORD OEM PART number 5M6Z-8C419-A) It did help in cooling the Motor electronics coolant temperature a little bit however the traction battery FANS are still an issue which I am continuing to investigate using this Automotive computer Gauge.FYI, There is a disturbing trend in these line of 2005-2007 FORD Escape hybrid vehicles that calls for Air-Conditioning compressor to turn ON as soon as the HV battery temp reaches 95 to 96.8 F to cool the battery using the rear air-conditioning contraption by opening the blend door and what not but as your car ages the Internal two fans housed inside the HV battery tends to fail slowly (without actually flagging any DTC codes) and thereby no matter how much AC compressor works hard (Only with ICE running) it cannot cool the HV battery enough to go under 94F for the ICE to stop at idle or at a STOP sign.It is winter here in California and thanks for mother nature my HV battery rarely calls for cooling for most of the stop and go traffic and I still have not ventured to replace the two Internal HV battery FANs (FORD OEM PART 5M6Z-10C659-A) on my Ford Escape Hybrid but I do closely monitor the temperatures using this valuable tool.Bottom line: An excellent tool to have for any gasoline or diesel engines for real-time MPG and RPM readings as well as read understand and clear (Check Engine Light) DTC codes.\", u'Well worth the price as it pay for itself in less than a year if you come across a check engine light and could decode yourself and clear it.', u'Or just by using this tool to carefully change your driving habits and improving the gas mileage.I am amazed how crazy some drivers are who accelerate hard cut in front of you, overtake you just to stop in front of you at a STOP Light.', u'Did you know how much Gas you could save just by decelerating slowly and watch for the traffic pattern ahead of you?', u'- You can save nearly 30% of your gas tank not to mention less wear and tear of you brakes and other stuff when you learn to drive less aggressively.Drive safe!, Drive intelligently and save on gas!Cheers!', u'I bought a used car that has oxygen sensor issues... and replacing said sensor is a nightmare and extremely expensive (long story).', u'If the oxygen sensor trips a code than many of the functions of my car stop working.', u\"(What a nightmare and a sick feature as far as I'm concerned).\", u'I bought this and mounted it permanently in my car and when I get the occasional sensor code I can handily reset the code and continue on my merry way.', u'Having all of the other information available is so convenient and the manual is user friendly.', u'I love this and want one for all of my vehicles.', u\"I saw a review on Mojo channel where the reviewer used the MPG display to increase mileage.Based on this I bought one and I'm not disappointed.I can see this easily paying for itself in less than a year.The real time MPG display allows you to tame that lead foot and get awesome mileage on a long run.I did an 8 hour drive last week and must have got conservatively 5MPG better fuel economy.\", u'You do have to work at viewing the display and feeding it back to that right foot.', u\"Very easy to install - under 5 minutes.If you're not a gadget fan then don't buy it.\", u'This product works well, but is too expensive and needs a swivel mount bracket.', u'For $160 the only mounting hardware included is double-stick velcro!', u'Consequently, your only alternative is to stick it to the angled surfaces of your dash or steering column, which makes it difficult to find the best viewing angle.As far as the price, I found a discount code online that reduced it nearly 20%.After two years it still works great.', u'A snap to install, and easily transferred from one vehicle to another.', u\"I couldn't believe all the information that you can get off of the car's computer system.\", u'I bought this to monitor my oil and water temp deltas on my 03 6.0L Excursion.', u\"It's a great tool to keep an eye on your motor, the factory idiot gauges warn you about issues when it's way too late.\", u'I suggest getting a Blendmount to go with your ScanGauge.', u'The install will look so much cleaner.', u'I used this tool to determine I had a bad battery as well as determining the health of my oil cooler.', u'Well worth its price.', u\"This is a nifty little device that attaches to your vehicle's OBDII port under the dash.\", u\"It is adaptable to most vehicles (visit Scangauge's website to be sure yours is on the list).\", u'Interestingly, it interfaces via an ethernet port.', u'I used it on a Ford Taurus, A Mercury Grand Marquis, and a Dodge Caravan.', u'Yes, it displays real time MPG data.', u'It also gives you the average time weighted average MPG.', u'RPM, MPH,and TPS data- no problem.', u'Coolant temperature, Ditto.', u'Manifold absolute pressure depends on the vehicle.', u'Same with intake air temperature.', u'It does not give the actual O2 sensor reading, only if the loop is closed or open.', u'It will definitely teach you skills to improve your fuel economy.', u'Surprisingly, the larger your engine the better you will do because you can take advantage of low rpm high torque situations.', u'I got 29.1 MPG with my Grand Mark using it (Averaged over 65 miles in city, highway and country backroads passing Amish Buggies) Philadelphia to Lancaster, PA.', u\"I would have given it 5 stars but the materials it is made with are lightweight and I'm not sure if it will stand the test of time.\", u\"It is a very useful gadget, and it is a shame we can't hook it up to a laptop to send the data to the state DOT to pass emissions inspection.\", u'I suggest ScanGauge look into this, it would probably only take a software upgrade, I know the hardware is up to task.', u'I also suggest they encase it in shockproof rubber to protect it.This is a follow up review  5000 miles out from the last review.', u'I revised the unit to 5 stars.', u'Its durability has proven the test of time and jockeying between 3 vehicles.', u'It sits nicely above the wheel of my V8 Grand Marquis with no significant dash obstruction.', u'It maves easily from vehicle to vehicle an is capable of taking a hit bere or there.', u'It would still be nice to have a shockproof rubber case but I upped my rating to 5 stars both because it held up well and it helped me average between 24-28 MPG country in my Grand Mark.', u'It paid for itself in gasoline already.', u'Anything more is gravy now.', u'The only thing I suggest is a list of OBD codes to go with the unit.', u'It is no longer as easy to find them using google because the mechanics and auto makers want to keep this information proprietary.', u'Google OBD and the first 50 entries are either discussion boards, parts suppliers, or sensor makers.', u'The same happens when you seek out a specific code.', u'You have to dig but you can find what they mean.', u'A list would be nice.']\n"

- Alternatives - - -- The180-watt versionis the same size, only 5% heavier, and sometimes no more expensive.- Many other brands.\", u'Most stick up higher and have fewer USB ports.- - - Notes - - -Note 1: I tested it for about 15 minutes, charging my MacBook Pro (60-watt power supply) and iPhone (5 watts).', u'It did not get unreasonably hot.~~~ Comments & questions welcome ~~~ We, like most families these days, have lots of portable electronic equipment including smartphones, laptops, Bluetooth speakers, Bluetooth keyboards, and such.', u\"When we go on a trip with 4 people in the car it isn't unusual to have as many as five of these devices being used, sometimes at the same time.\", u'There never seems to be enough charging outlets available.', u'This little device fills the bill for us.We have been using a 140 Watt inverter for a few years already.', u\"It has two AC outlets but no USB ports so isn't nearly as handy as this new one.\", u'The old one has an internal fan, and a bit of a noisy fan it is.', u'We are all relieved when we turn it off and get rid of that raspy sound.', u'Also that old inverter is about 2\" x 7\" x 5\" so quite large in comparison to this Energizer 120W unit.I tried plugging in my 14\" laptop, and two Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphones and it worked just fine.', u\"With no internal fan it is completely quiet.As a few others have said taking up a cup holder isn't very practical unless you have one of those cars with a zillion cup holders.\", u'Our two cars only have two cup holders in the front seat, and we use both of them most of the time.', u'So we put this Energizer in the arm rest closed compartment.', u\"One concern I have, and I'll have to monitor it, is will this Energizer overheat when placed in the arm rest compartment and put to heavy use.My only complaint is when I actually did have it in a cup holder, and it was night time, the blue light is bright and I could see it's reflection off the two side windows in the front seat so it was a bit distracting.\", u\"Since we'll be keeping it in the arm rest box it won't be an issue.\", u'In other cases when bright LED lights bothered me I put a piece of black electrical tape over the light and just poke a small hole in the tape so I can see the light, which works fine.', u\"I've done this with several pieces of equipment.It's a nicely designed, and seemingly sturdy little device.\", u\"I've had a number of these style inverters and each one had I hated.\", u'The reason was some were built very cheaply, there would be a fan running that was loud in the device itself and even with a car radio on you could hear this hum coming from your cup holder.', u'Others were just built so cheap and they cracked in the heat of being in the car when parked.', u\"This however is very solid, it's quiet and it has more than enough plugs for even me.\", u'It has 1 AC outlet which I used to run my laptop off of when traveling.', u\"It also features 4 usb plugs which for me allows me to plug my GS4, nexus tablet and GPS (if I bring my standalone) in with one plug to spare.I use a fitbit so it's handy being able to charge that while on the road driving.If you are looking for a power inverter this is a great one.\", u'It does come with 2 plugs, a cigarette lighter as well as clamps so you could hook it directly to a battery if you needed to.', u'This thing is really cool.', u\"It's a sleek car charger that fits into any standard car cup holder.\", u\"The cord isn't super long, so your cup holder ideally needs to be fairly close to your car's accessory port (or cigarette lighter, as they used to be called.\", u')CompactThis thing is about the size of an 8oz cup.', u\"It's kind of stout, like the beverage cups they usually give on airlines, so it doesn't take up much room or add clutter.4 Convenient USB Ports - Enough to ShareThese days, we all have multiple devices that need to be charged.\", u'And since USB is becoming the standard, the 4 USB ports on this charger can juice up most anything with a USB cable.', u\"And there's enough ports to go around, so whoever's riding shotgun can plug in their devices too!BONUS -- AC Plug Power Inverter too!This cool little thing even has a 3-prong AC power inverter, so you can plug in virtually anything with a standard AC cord and use it in your car -- laptop, tablet, emergency light, beverage cooler, hotplate (LOL) -- virtually anything with a standard wall plug!\", u'I have many extra gadgets, so the bonus AC outlet has proven to be very handy and convenient.Bottom Line - really love this cup holder car charger.', u'Offers a lot of bang for the buck and all packed into a very compact and well made gadget.', u'Love it!', u'Happy!', u';oD Well, I liked this product so much the first time, that I had to get another for our 2nd vehicle!Love how it fits into the cup holder, and the multiple charging ports are a huge plus, and came in handy while on a recent road trip.', u'No more fighting over who gets the charging port!An added plus is the AC plug in for those weird moments when you need one.', u'It also has 4 USB ports so you can charge pretty much anything that you need to while in a car.', u'What I like:-- Fits into one of the two cup holders with wiggle room for air circulation.-- Has 4 USB ports and one standard 120 volt receptacle.', u'I like that I can re-charge several small devices at one time instead of having to take turns.', u'I can charge my iPod, cell phone, GPS and android tablet if I want too although the more connected the slower the charging will be.', u'But really, do you need to use 5 devices at one time???', u\"And personally, I wouldn't use all 5 ports at the same time because I bet something will overload the 120W limit.-- cigarette adapter fits perfectly into the cigarette lighter hole-- Bright blue light tells me it's working-- No fan noise-- comes with battery clamp cables-- can standard AC receptacle to use/charge notebook computer.\", u\"Don't try to power anything beyond that - no blow dryers, etc...What I don't like:-- Takes up one of my two cup holders-- Excellent change of liquid getting sloshed into it since all ports are face up.So, I have more likes than dislikes.\", u\"This product also come with one set of battery clamp cables that I don't think anyone else has mentioned.\", u'It looks just like a very small set of car jumper cables.', u\"I'm not really sure what to do with this cable because the instructions that came with this Inverter Cup made absolutely no mention of them.\", u\"I suppose it's an alternative way to power your devices without using a car's cigarette lighter connection and to power your devices directly off the car's battery with the car not running.\", u\"I haven't tried doing that yet, but it's nice to have that option, though after some time it will drain your battery.\", u'This is a very nice central charging port for our busy family.', u'It has help up very well and has been perfect for our long car trips.', u'After nearly a month of use, it has given us no trouble.', u'It charges our iPads and iPhones just fine.', u'It struggled to charge a closed laptop, but did great for smaller devices like cameras.', u\"So it doesn't take the place of a more powerful inverter, but it is silent and compact and worked great for smaller items.\", u'I knocked it one star for the overly-bright blue LED that lights up when the power is plugged in.', u'Not bad during the day, but at night in a dark car, it is very distracting.', u'We put a pice of electrical tape over it.', u'Like the charger, and can recommend it.', u'I just love this little inverter, fits right into your cup holder and has more than enough ports for whatever you need to charge.', u\"I'm always forgetting to charge my phone, so having this along with an extra cable in my car has been a life saver for me!\", u'The Energizer 120W Cup Inverter is a must for heavy travelers and those on the go.', u\"I've used inverters before, but this is my first with USB ports.\", u'It packs the power, the portability, and function that you would expect from Energizer.The cup shape is awesome.', u\"If you have used an inverter before, you've likely had it sitting in your floor.\", u'While this takes up the space of a cup holder, the ease and access to the ports makes it worthwhile.', u'You can plug up a laptop or tablet or several other gadgets into the AC power.', u'Or use one of the 4 USB ports.', u'If you travel with a laptop, tablet, GPS unit, phone, or countless other items, then this cup inverter will almost always come in handy for you.', u'If you have a laptop that requires more power you may wish to opt for another inverter.', u'Personally, my primary use is for all the USB ports, especially if you are travelling with multiple people as you can charge several phones at once.', u'The cigarette lighter cord has decent length and is certainly long enough to reach most lighters.Overall, a handy device that is great for travelling and to keep in your car for the unexpected need.', u\"The ENERGIZER 120W Cup Inverter fits perfectly inside my car's cup holder and keeps my iPhone charged - I use a navigation app on my iPhone and the trips are usually a couple hours each way.\", u\"The problem I had before was I didn't have a charger for the iPhone and the nav app really drains the battery fast.The ENERGIZER 120W Cup Inverter solved that problem.\", u'And since it fits perfectly inside my cup holder, it is out of the way but there when I need it.', u'My wife love it because she can use her laptop on some of our longer excursions without worrying about draining the battery.For me the four UBS ports are more then enough and its great to have the option of plugging in a laptop or other small appliance.', u'The convenience and small form factor easily earn this product 5 stars from me.', u'I recommend it.', u\"Cool Things about this device:+ 4 USB Ports AND an AC outlet+ Fits in the cup holder+ Compact+ High Capacity - 120V+ Sturdy - good qualityWhat I didn't like in actual use:- Cord is too short.\", u\"When both the driver and front seat passenger have a drink, the inclination is to move this out of the cup holder, because unlike the drinks - it won't spill.\", u\"But then the cord won't reach the lighter.- Bright Blue power light.\", u\"OK in the day but distracting at night.- I left it plugged in ONCE when I wasn't in the car.\", u'WHen I returned, there was a funny electrical smell coming from it.', u\"Since that was concerning, I'm always careful now to keep it unplugged when not in use.\", u'This small, lightweight gadget by Energizer adds ports to your car that it should have come with from the get-go.', u'There are more Apple products, for example, in use in this country than there are people - that tells you something.', u'Many people have multiple devices - tablets, smartphones, laptops - and one day, Yoda-hologram R2-units.', u'Just wait.', u'Trying to get that report done while the shuttle drives you to the airport?', u\"Plug this in the cigarette lighter and plug in your laptop - and this way you'll still have a full battery when you get on the plane!\", u'It conveniently fits in most drink-holders in cars and the fan is whisper quite.', u\"The blue indicator light lets you know it's getting power from your car battery.\", u\"It's really nice to be able to have a multitude of devices plugged in when we are on a road trip and this is the lightest weight inverter I've ever seen.\", u'I have another one - big and bulky (and one plug inverter, no USB ports at all) that is big, square, and heavy.', u'This can easily be tossed in purse or locked in a glove compartment.', u'This Energizer 120W inverter arrived the day before I started off on a 19 hour drive to Florida, which was a great opportunity to test it out.', u'I had 2 cell phones, an iPad, and an iPad mini plugged into the USB ports to charge.', u\"Later on, I plugged in my daughter's LeapPad Ultra charger into the 3-prong AC power inverter.It's a very handy item, and fits unobtrusively into the cup holder of my Toyota Prius.\", u\"Unfortunately, I only have 2 cup holders in my car, so I do miss having the use of one while I'm using this.\", u\"On a day-to-day basis, I'm still using a small Belkin car charger for my phone.\", u'But I keep this in the glove compartment for those times when I need to charge multiple devices.', u'This cup inverter it&#8217;s a great idea, and it can also be used at home matched with a sealed acid battery, it comes with the alligator clamps for it.', u'There are two things to keep in mind though, if being used on a car or inside the house, the inverter has little ventilation slits around its case, if one places it on a cup for a long time it will get hot, this will shorten its lifespan because circuits don&#8217;t like heat and it can even be dangerous.', u'So, I recommend getting one of those cup holders that only are made of a plastic ring that held the cup by the top part.', u'In this way the inverter would still have air for ventilation.', u'If an open cup holder it&#8217;s not available, then the best is to give the inverter time to cool off after each gadget recharging.It comes with an AC outlet and four USB ports, but one must remember that it has a limit of 120 Watts, so it will only be able to charge up to that wattage regardless of the amount of devices plug into it.']\n"

      "[u\"I've used some of those other glass products and never noticed a difference but this is the real deal.\", u'Takes a bit of work and time to do it right - just like waxing your car.', u'Well worth the effort.', u'Of course, the rain stopped right after I applied this, but it seems to have made cleaning up bugs and such easier.', u\"I'll update this review if I get the chance to test it in the rain.\", u'This is a little bit labor-intensive to apply, but well worth it.', u\"I was skeptical at first, but a couple days after I gave my Jeep the ol' Griot's Glass Sealant treatment, it rained, and the rain just danced off my windshield.\", u\"My wipers didn't have to work as hard.\", u\"And it's true.\", u'The &#34;bug jerky&#34;- Ha!', u'pops off a lot easier after having the windshield treated with this.', u\"I'm going to be treating all our cars with this glass sealant!\", u\"I've used this stuff, intermittently, for years.\", u'It definitely has a place in the automotive detailing pantheon.', u'If you are the type that keeps your car sparkling clean, and waxes it religiously, a &#34;slick&#34; coating of petroleum-based magic (Rain-X is the same thing) over your glass, to help keep it water-stain free and dirt repellant, truly is the icing on the cake.', u'But it definitely takes some time and commitment to get the coating right, with repeated applications.', u'You can actually eliminate the need for using wipers by applying it on your windshield, but, realize that if you decide to start using your wipers, you will get a hazy mess for quite a few strokes.', u\"Classic car owners that don't drive in the rain all that often, and have flaky/ineffectual wiper mechanisms, love this stuff.It's also very important to PROPERLY clean all the glass (not just if it's a windscreen you're dealing with) before applying this.\", u'Note that polishing your windshield on occasion is a good idea anyway, and is a huge factor in allowing your wipers to work their best.', u\"A reasonably cheap electric glass cooktop polish (like Wieman brand) works nicely.When considering this product, you need to ask yourself if it's worth the effort.\", u'If you regularly encounter clinging dirt/mud or ice in your travels, it probably is.', u'Because clean up will go much easier.', u\"Also, if your car is parked on a highly traffic'd urban street, rinsing the windows with plain water will get them perfectly translucent again, even if it's been parked for a few days.Having clean glass is a safety concern, and so should be a priority.\", u'The multiple treatments and overall time it takes to get it right, though, means I subtract one star.', u\"In my mind, there are three leading auto glass 'sealant' treatments out there - Rain-X, Aquapel, and this product, Griot's Glass Sealant.\", u'Aquapel is the most expensive of the three, and as far as i can tell, it is the clear leader in terms of function and longevity.', u'But for about as much as this 8 oz bottle costs, you get one or possibly two Aquapel applicators, each of which contains just enough solution to treat one windshield or rear window.', u\"But there is no question that Aquapel is pretty miraculous stuff - properly applied, it makes rain skitter across your windshield and fly off into the ozone, and it remains effective for months, even with frequent trips to the local car wash.Griot's Glass Sealant and Rain-X appear to me to be more or less equivalent and second tier.\", u'Both will go on relatively easy.', u'Both will give your auto glass a clear coating that has moderate water-shedding properties.', u'Both seem to last a few weeks at most before requiring a new coat.But if you do not mind applying Glass Sealant every few weeks - and it really is not a chore - and if you do not demand the somewhat amazing rain shedding properties of Aquapel, then this reasonably priced 8 ounce bottle of the stuff represents good value for money.', u\"Me, I'm willing to spend the extra coin for the Aquapel treatment.\", u\"Here in the Pacific Northwest, it's really nice to be able to cruise along at 30 or 40 mph and watch the rain literally fly off your windshield, driven away by the force of the wind on the glass - you barely need to use your wipers.\", u\"Glass Sealant doesn't quite amaze, but it does make your wipers work far more effectively than they do on untreated glass.\", u\"Sometimes your windshield wipers can't keep up with a downpour, or perhaps they are starting to wear and you forgot to replace them.\", u'A glass sealant like this can help by speeding up the movement of rain off the windshield.This product has a strong alcohol odor.', u\"It's not difficult to apply as long as you can easily reach your entire windshield.\", u'(I cannot unless I stand on a stool.', u')Cleaning your window carefully before applying this.', u'We have a surplus of minerals in our water and I was not able to get all the calcium spots off the windshield, even though I cleaned it with a spray glass cleaner followed by wiping with a microfiber cloth.', u\"I applied the sealant to the driver's side windshield only, in order to see what difference it made.\", u'It broke up the hard water spots so now they are tinier spots but more of them.', u'Still, the overall clarity is improved.When rain hits the windshield, it rolls off faster than it would without the sealant.', u\"I've observed this before with a different (but similar) product and I think it can be very helpful.\", u\"I like this product, but, it's not a WOW type of product.\", u\"It does it's job and nothing more, but, nothing less.\", u\"Not sure I'll buy it again as I have other products that do just as well or better for less money.\", u\"I'd give this product a 6/10 where as I prefer 8/10 or better when I buy some of these boutique type car products.\", u'I thought that this product would be a pain to use.', u\"The instructions are to apply, dry to a haze, buff and repeat the steps.It is easy to apply and buff out so it wasn't bad after all.\", u'I did 6 windows on a Honda CRV and by the time I worked my way around the car it was ready to buff.', u'Then I just worked my way around again.', u'The whole process only took about 20 minutes and I used about 1/5 of the bottle.', u'The windows looked great and I anxiously awaited rain to see how it performed.While I was waiting for the first rain one morning the car had condensation on it and drops had dribbled down the windshield and back window.', u'I turned on the wipers to clear the window and was shocked to see that the path of the dribbles had etched into the sealant surface and the marks would not go away.', u\"I tried using washer fluid and it wouldn't clear it either.\", u'Driving into the sun that first day was not pleasant.', u'The marks have faded to the point they are not noticeable anymore, two weeks later they were faint but still there.When the coat of sealant is fresh, about the first week, rain will just slide off the windshield.', u'In a misting rain even the intermittent wipers would not be needed.', u'When the wipers are used they sweep the rain off cleanly without leaving streaks.', u'Three weeks after the first application the wipers still clean the windows with no streaks.', u'After 4 weeks the windows need another application.I was ready to write a scathing review after the condensation etching issue but the fact it allows my wipers to do a much better job so long after application has endeared the product to me because no matter how new my wipers were they streak the windshield and of course the streak is always right in front of the driver.My only previous experience with a product like this was with RainX.', u'I hated applying RainX because it was so difficult to buff out and as the coating wears off it caused a terrible chattering from the wiper blades so I quit using it.', u\"OK, I'm a Griot's Garage product fan.\", u\"I have been using their products for years and have yet to find one that wasn't as good or , in most cases, better than similar products on the market.\", u\"The same holds true with this glass sealer.Briefly, the idea behind this product is that it seals the glass on your car's windows with a wax-like coating so that rain drops slide easily off as you drive.\", u\"The first time I used a product like this (Rain-X), I was fascinated by the rain dance the droplets did as they scooted off all of the windows (NOTE: it's not just for the front windscreen!)\", u'However, I have noticed that recently, Rain-X has stopped being as effective as it had been (formula change?)', u\"so this new offering tempted me.Quick report - it's better than my old faithful Rain-X.\", u'But my report is only partially complete because products like this also make getting frost and squished bugs off the glass a lot easier.', u'in NJ, we are in-between frost and bug season so a more &#34;complete&#34; report is not possible.', u\"However, it does a darn fine job in rain so I suspect that it will work fine on frost, snow, and bugs.Note - if you have an older car with a rock &#34;peppered&#34; windshield, this and any other similar product the effect won't be as magical.\", u'These chemicals seem to like new, smooth glass best.', u\"But they will work well on the side and back glass - really something special if you've never tried it.Finally, your windows have to be CLEAN.\", u'Really clean.', u\"Griot's makes a glass polish that I used in preparation for this test and it makes the glass as clean as you can get it.Drive in rain or snow?\", u'Have morning frost or summer bug splatter to clean off?', u'Try this product.', u'It worked for me.', u'The primary test of this product is how well it lasts and performs when much of the water on the windshield is sprayed up from the road surface and thus is contaminated with dirt and oil and being rubbed across the windshield by the wipers.', u'I live in a locale where winter is the rainy season and unfortunately this review sample arrived two days after what was likely the last non-trivial rain for many months so I have been unable to do this primary test before this review was due.I use this type of product outside the rainy season because it makes cleaning the windows faster and better.', u'Since I try to park under trees for shade, bird droppings are not just inevitable, but almost immediate.', u'And then there is dust from unending construction in the area.', u'So far, this has been doing an excellent job.', u\"For comparative testing I left some window areas untreated -- a strip on the far side of the windshield and on the rear window, and I treated only one of my station wagon's back panel windows.\", u'Substantial positive difference.Application was easy.', u'From the instructions, I expected a significant haze to form -- and be buffed out -- but there was a barely perceptible one (not complaining -- it means that there is little product being wasted).The cap on the bottle has two minor problems:First, it pours sloppily.', u\"This is not a problem when treating a windshield because you don't need to be precise in wetting the cloth.\", u'However, if you want to do a small job, such as the outside mirrors,...Second, that the cap is to be pulled up to open the center hole is not obvious to some -- it takes more force than people expect and the label on the cap is difficult to spot and almost impossible to read (small print, minimal elevation produces negligible contrast in many lighting conditions).', u'Consequently, some may treat it as a cap to be unscrewed.--- Douglas B. Moran First of all, you need to make sure your windshield is REALLY clean before you apply this.', u'Not just squeegeed-at-the-gas-station clean, but really soap-and-water-and-towels-and-rinsed-and-buffed-dry clean.', u'Then you can apply it.', u\"There are several different opinions on what is best to use for applying, and I'm not qualified to make that call, so you'll have to ask someone else that.\", u'But at the very least, plan on having a bag of lint-free towels.You have to apply the product in a \"cross-hatch\" pattern, let it dry to a haze, apply it again, let it dry to haze again, then buff it thoroughly till it\\'s crystal clear all over.', u\"If you wax your car regularly, this might seem like no big deal (and you're going to love this stuff, and you probably already use something like this, so I'm wasting your time here).\", u\"But if you're not much of one for detailing your car, this is going to seem like a lot of work.However, one you get it on properly, it really does work well.\", u'It will repel not only water, but dust and grime, too.', u'It makes it easier to remove frost and ice from your windows.', u'Baked-on bugs are easier to remove.', u'Your wipers will be more quiet.', u\"It's a great product, but just know what you're getting yourself in for as far as application.\", u\"As usual, Griot's products are top-notch.\", u\"What I won't do, is lie to you and tell you that this is completely different than Rain-X.\", u'What I will do is tell you that this is a great product, which works at least as well as Rain-X, and comes from a brand I trust for products to use on my car.Is there anything wrong with just using the inexpensive Rain-X?', u'No, not at all.', u'This stuff feels the same, smells the same, etc.', u\"Actually, Rain-X is probably even a bit easier to apply, considering it comes in a spray bottle.So, the product works great, but it's likely more expensive than a competing product, and I don't doubt that the competing product performs just as well.\", u\"I used this on my wife's car, which probably just needs new wiper blades.\", u\"But this helped significantly to get the water to bead up and out of the way (instead of the wet 'smears' we got before).\", u\"It's a bit of work to spread it on and wipe off - kind of like waxing the car - but the results were good.\", u\"We haven't had rain in months, so I can't say how well it'll work in an actual storm, but if testing with the hose is any indication, it should be just fine.\", u\"I am a big fan of Griot's Garage products; however, this is one that I had never before tried.\", u'I assumed that it would be pretty much the same as a well-known product that comes in a yellow spray bottle and that includes a reference to liquid precipitation in its name.', u\"Actually, Griot's Garage seems to be better.\", u\"One of the issues that I've had with that other product is the unavoidable overspray.\", u\"That's not a problem with this product.\", u\"The Griot's Garage Glass Sealant also makes for much easier cleaning of bugs and sap than the yellow-bottled product.\", u\"The rain beading for which the other product is famous is also part of the Griot's Garage products repertory, but this does so much more.\", u'Highly recommended!', u\"I have used the Griot's Glass Sealant in all four seasons - where the seasons can all be ugly in their own way.\", u'In winter, you can have sleet, snow, ice, and rain... in the spring it is rain and pollen.', u'Summer brings us downpour storms and bird droppings.', u'Each of these create their own challenges for drivers trying to keep a clean windshield and good visibility.', u\"Griot's Glass Sealant addresses them all.Water just beads right off the glass - whether is is a mild drizzle or a severe thunderstorm.\", u'You will find that you seldom need to even use your wipers, and when you do employ them it is like they are on steroids, leaving a like-new glass surface with each swipe.', u'Cleaning the windshield is also much easier.', u'Whether doing your weekly (or monthly) washing, or trying to remove that huge splatter that a passing bird just deposited in your field of view - the treated glass cleans effortlessly and completely.The product is easy to apply: ensure you glass is clean and dry, and then using a foam or terry applicator just apply it in vertical and horizontal wipes, to ensure full coverage.', u'The sealant will glaze over and give the glass a fogged look.', u\"Make sure you didn't miss any spots, and then just buff it until it is clear.\", u'This is easy and does not take incredible force.I have found the Glass Sealant to last much longer than I expected it to.', u'Depending on the time of year, and what it has to deal with in terms of weather, it can last a couple of months and remain very effective.', u'Your wipers will last longer for two reasons - first because you are using them less; and second because when you do use them, they are gliding over a smooth treated surface with less friction.', u\"This prevents the rubber blade from wearing as it normally would.The Griot's Glass Sealant is a staple in my garage, and something I automatically reorder when the bottle gets low.\", u'Highly recommended!', u\"I've used the 'other' windshield sealing product for decades.\", u'I bought it when it was an infomercial special.', u'Once I got it applied right I was amazed at how it improved driving in almost every wet weather situation.', u\"Light mist being the one thing these products don't handle well.\", u\"So I was happy to try the Griot's Garage version when it was offered.Application was easy.\", u'One small towel wet with the product applied in a crosshatch pattern on the windows.', u'Wait a few minutes for that coat to dry and apply a second coat.', u'Then buff off with another, clean, towel.', u\"Just about the same as the 'other' product except I used to use a wet method of buffing off theirs and Griot's only mentions using a dry towel to remove the haze that forms when you apply this.I must say that the Griot's Garage window sealant buffed off much easier than Rain-X (there, I said it) ever did.\", u\"I don't know if that's a good or bad thing.\", u\"Does it buff off so easily because it's leaving less product applied to the window or is it just formulated better?\", u'Or was the wet method I used to use just that bad at getting the job done?', u\"I really can't say at this point.Fortunately just a day or two after applying this the Florida weather kicked up several hours of serious downpours while I was out.\", u'I was even test driving a new Kia in the middle of the storms and really wished I had been back in my car when the rain got heavy.This stuff works.', u'Just as well as Rain-X (I said it again) ever did.', u'Rain water beads up and at speeds over 30mph or so just shoot right the heck off the windshield.', u'At slower speeds they quickly slide down the glass.', u'I usually get one rainy season out of a coating on my car.', u\"I'm driving a bit more than I have in the past years so I'm sure this will be put to the test frequently.\", u\"When it starts to wear off and needs another application I'll come back and update this review.Things I wanted to note:The bottle works differently; lift the cap so the dimple that seals it is lowered inside the cap.\", u'I found that no matter what I did product leaked out from around the bottom lip of the cap you lift up to dispense the sealer.', u\"I probably wasted a  more product than I used due to this leakage.This product, compared to Rain-X is expensive (yes, I received this for free but I made myself aware of the price to provide a comprehensive review) in fact it's several times more expensive than the old style flip-top Rain-X product that is still available.\", u\"Griot's clear bottle lets you see easier when you're running low but I can't detect any real difference between the two products, they smell and apply exactly the same.\", u\"Griot's only benefit was buffing off easier.I'll report back with a longevity update.\", u\"Perhaps Griot's Garage Glass Sealant will last significantly longer.\", u'This is a great product.', u'It makes &#34;stuff&#34; slide off the glass you seal this in with.', u'&#34;Stuff&#34; being the usual things like rain, but also dust and dirt and insect and the sort.', u'The better you clean the area and smooth it out before applying, the better the slicking and sliding off the &#34;stuff&#34; will go.The product is easy to use and the directions are clear.', u'Not much else needs to be said, the only reason I deducted a star is because the cost.', u'Rain-X, a competing product, can be had for less.', u'Other than that, this is a great product and well recommended.', u'Well, in my less than controlled test between Griot&#8217;s and Rain-X, the results were&#8230;inconclusive.', u'Meaning, I can&#8217;t see a difference in effectiveness or notable differences in application that would make one preferable over the other.I did all exterior window surfaces on one side of the car with the tried and trusted Rain-X and the other with this product following the rather minor differences in application recommendations for each.', u'After two months (with a whole lot of rain episodes and a bunch of highway road trips), I don&#8217;t feel any significant differences in performance are evident.In essence, I don&#8217;t have any reservations about using the Griot Glass sealant in replacement of the Rain-X product I have used for years however based on comparative pricing, it will not be my first choice.', u'This product is very similar to Rain-X, it helps water roll off your windows and protects them.', u\"By using this I am also extending the life of my wipers since I don't need to use them as much.\", u'This is easy to apply, works well and I would recommend it.', u\"It's been a while since I used Rain-X on my cars, but I received this through Vine and gave it a shot.\", u\"Application is simple enough, I prepped the window with Adam's Glass cleaner (best product out there).\", u\"I followed by applying the Griot's Glass sealant as directed, in a crossed pattern.\", u'It dried very quickly, going from one arm reach to the other side of the car, and repeating, the other side was dry and ready for the second coat.', u\"I buffed it off with a microfiber cloth, and noticed how many imperfections my glass has.Two days later, it rained relatively lightly, it was a rain that was just to the point that you'd want an umbrella.\", u'At about 30 mph the beadlets began evacuating the windshield on my Honda Pilot.', u\"I'm sure that this speed will differ based on aerodynamics (or lack thereof with the Pilot).\", u\"There is a noticeable difference in the bottom portion of the windshield, protected by the hood where the water isn't affected by the wind coming over the car.Used in conjunction with wipers on a heavier rain, the windshield was cleared far more effectively than using just wipers.\", u'For reference, I use Bosch Icon blades.This bottle will last a long time.', u'I was generous in the application, and there was little difference in the volume left in the bottle after doing two cars.', u\"If you've ever used Rain-X all I need to say is this is the exact same stuff, though curiously twice the current price.If you are not familiar with Rain-X-read on...To apply the product you first need to clean your windshield.\", u\"Consider using a bug & tar remover if there are specks that won't come off because they will negatively effect your results.\", u'Then you smear the sealant thoroughly over the entire windshield with a clean cloth and let dry to a haze.', u\"Repeat, to make sure you've got full coverage.\", u'Now comes the elbow grease part.', u\"You've got to wipe forever to get all the haze and streaks off until the thing shines--well, like glass.\", u\"I will say the Griot's product seemed to take less effort in this stage than the Rain-X.After application, you will notice a dramatic difference the first time you drive in the rain.\", u'Water will bead up and the wind created by your moving car will send the droplets shooting towards the upper edge in crazy, mesmerizing streams.', u\"You won't even need to turn your wipers on, unless its raining pretty hard.\", u'The drops will just stream away.', u'The best way I can explain what it looks like is to picture yourself at the helm of the Millenium Falcon as it goes into hyperspace.', u\"Honestly, it's almost dangerously distracting because it's so interesting to watch.\", u'Certainly gives a much cleaner, streak free view but be sure to get it all thoroughly wiped off or it will drag on your blades and cause them to stutter.', u\"I've been a Rain X user for many years, but the one negative side effect was that right after the wiper ran, it would leave a white haze for a fraction of a second trailing the blade.\", u\"It was annoying, and after Rain X came out with their wiper fluid, I converted over to that instead, because it seemed to cause less haze.Using the Rain X wiper fluid year round can get a little expensive, and always, the car dealer or the place that changes my oil would top me off with some standard brand, so I'd lose my rain repelling functionality when it gets diluted.Application was just as easy as Rain X, and had a definitely-more-distinct rubbing alcohol smell than my last use of Rain X.So far, I have been pleased with the result.\", u'I will update the review going forward as I learn how long the application lasts, and if it causes water spotting on my side and rear window like the Rain X product did, due to the beading action.', u\"I'd assume this may be the same, but if it's different I will report back.One full application of 2 coats took about 1/4 of the container on a full sized sedan.\", u\"A year or so ago I treated my car's windshield withAquapel, which is well thought of though expensive.\", u\"It has worn off so I was interested in seeing how the Griot's Garage Glass Sealant worked.\", u'It applies easily and, most important, the dried-to-a-haze material buffs off easily.', u\"I've had issues before with sealants that left a foggy haze on the glass even after extensive buffing, but the Griot's cleaned up well with a microfiber cloth.As luck would have it, it rained the next day so I could see how it performed.\", u'True to the claim, water beaded and ran off once the car was underway.', u'Misting water did tend to stay in place, but the wiper cleaned that off easily.', u'Given the amount of sealant one gets, I was able to also treat the back window (I have a station wagon and it cruds up quickly), plus the side mirrors.', u\"The sealant did keep the glass cleaner in the rain and the wipers seemed to run smoother.I don't think the Griot's sealant will last as long as Aquapel, but it is much less expensive per use and pretty easy to apply, so that's a win for me.\", u'This glass sealant seems to work just as well but not necessarily better than Rain X.', u'It also appears to last about the same amount of time on the glass.I much prefer the bottle and applicator of this versus Rain X however would likely buy whichever is cheaper next time since the performance of each product seems about the same to me.', u'I will come right out of the gate and explain that I found the constant application and re-applications and buffing to be tedious, time consuming and annoying.', u'If you enjoy working on your car and have time to kill then this may be worthwhile time spent but if you are like my husband and myself then it leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to the wasted time.The glass sealant works but you have to make sure that your windows are crystal clean or there will be a haze.', u'We have had a few storms, hot days and pigeon attacks.', u'The windows seem less dusty but the pigeon fecal matter now slides down rather than stay put.', u'The windshield wipers do effortlessly glide, which I personally love.', u'My only grip would be that this product seems to do exactly what our old RainX does!', u\"Seriously, there isn't much difference except for the fecal running.\", u'I am not sure what would motivate me to reach for this product over the RainX considering how annoying the application was.', u\"Maybe better results are yielded if used in conjunction with other Griot's Garage products?Recommend if you are in the market for a great glass cleaner that allows your windshield wipers to work effortlessly.\", u'The rain just glides off and there is a longer period of dustless windows.', u\"I cannot with good conscience though, suggest that this product is any different than it's competitor.\", u'This glass sealant is coming in especially handy as pollen season starts and my dark car begins to look like it is yellow.', u'The pollen does not seem to stick to windows, even the moon roof seems clear.', u\"The rain beads off and what frost we have had seems to scrape off the windscreens easier.Griot's seems to last longer than Rain X, I'm not positive if the extra cost is worth it.\", u\"The other difference is that I have to buff Griot's off which I do not have to do with Rain X.\", u\"The amount I had to use for my car was about the same for each- 1/8 of an ounce.It's a nice product, although not necessarily one of the necessities of life - it just makes car maintaining easier and pleasanter.\"]\n"

      "[u'i like washing and waxing my car myself.', u'it usually takes me most of the day and hepls me clear my mind.the thing that annoys me during waxing is when a little bit of water that was missed gets onto the pad i am using  to apply wax and creates mess.i tried terry cloth, bath cotton, and microfiber towels as well as a natural chamois to dry the car before waxing, and i determined that  i prefer microfiber towels.', u'before using Griots Garage towel i was using several smaller towels i bought at costco.i like this towel because it is large soft and absorbent.', u'i can dry the entire car with it.', u'however, i have to watch for it to not unfold and touch the ground.', u'once it does, i have switch to smaller  towels.', u'Goodbye, chamois.', u'You are being replaced with this microfiber towel.', u\"One wash & dry and I am hooked.The Griot's microfiber towel is thick and does a great job absorbing water on my car.\", u\"It does such a good job that I don't have to go over & over the car with the towel to ensure there is no streaking.\", u'There is no streaking with this towel!Add that the Griot\\'s microfiber towel is machine washable, and the Griot\\'s towel is a must-have if you want to \"baby\" your car.', u'I have a red car that I was too often, and have started using microfiber towels to dry it and windows..they work GREAT!', u'This one is nice as its SO THICK..its easily 3x as thick as the microfiber cloths I was using.', u'I just used it today after going through an auto car wash, pulled aside and wiped the glass then the car then the chrome, it still had room to absorb more.', u'I think this is a great addition to any garage or car trunk.', u\"I've used chamois clothes, the Absorber, and other varieties of microfiber drying cloths.\", u'This one is by-far my favorite.', u'I can dry my (small) car without wringing it out, with no water left behind to leave spots.', u'There are plenty of options here, really, any old towel will do, this one just absorbs a whole whack of water and makes the job simpler/faster; the best of the bunch.', u'Great towel!', u'It is larger than typical microfiber \"cloths\" (about the size of 4 small cloths) and is about the size of a regular hand towel.', u'I have not really seen a product like this - the microfiber is very thick and plush, almost spongy, so it absorbs an incredible amount of water.', u'The sewing on the edges does not cause scratching.', u'The towel works great for drying a car with no streaking.', u'I also plan to try for home cleaning (eg, washing/drying windows and floors) and general outdoor use.', u'For home cleaning, I may buy another and try to cut into smaller cloths.', u'I find that many of these automotive products translate well into multi-use.', u\"I have been satisfied with all Griot's Garage products I have tried so far.Fabric content: 80% polyester / 20% polyamide.\", u'Machine wash warm and dry, no bleach, fabric softener or ironing.', u'Made in China.I would rate as 4 1/2 stars due to the somewhat high price, rounding up to 5 stars.', u\"Griot's Garage Ultra-Thick Microfiber Towel is a great product.\", u'It is large enough to do the job, but not so large as to be unwieldy.', u'It absorbs quickly and is easy to wring out.To test its absorbency, I put it in a bowl and poured water on top of it.', u'It absorbed almost instantly and held over 20 ounces (about 2.5 cups).', u'This would be a GREAT item to have in your car-care kit.This towel would also be fantastic for household use.', u\"Keep one in the kitchen to quickly handle spilled drinks, etc.To get the most out of your towel, be sure to not use fabric softener when you wash it (true of any towel), and don't use it on anything that might have any grease or oil (it will permanently reduce the towel's absorbency, also something that is true of all towels).Though this towel is a little on the expensive side, it is well made, durable, easy to use, and very absorbent.\", u\"If the towel you currently use to dry your car needs to be wrung out frequently, you'll especially appreciate the holding capacity of this one.\", u\"Living in the Midwest, there hasn't been much opportunity to wash my GMC Savana conversion van.\", u'The weather has been lousy and way to cold and/or rainy to even think about cleaning the van inside or outside.', u'I have been using Shamwows to dry the van in past years and they truly worked well.', u'However, they require more wringing out than does this microfiber towel as it seems to absorb, absorb, absorb.', u'It is a valuable tool for car washing and drying, and probably for other uses as well.Highly  recommended.', u'\"Ultra thick microfiber towel\" does not really describe the product very well.', u\"I've got high quality thick MF towels but they are towels.\", u\"GG's MF 'towel' became available on Vine for free to review so I got it - you can never have enough quality MF towels, no?This is more like a cross between a pad and a towel.\", u'Almost like those MF dish drying matts.The nap is very dense so it really is for use as a drying tool rather than, say, a wax/polish removal tool.', u'It is hard to describe but it is sort of stiff even after washing and drying it.You could probably use it as a normal MF the the ones that are high quality and plush and more towel-like are going to give better results because the looser nap will pick up the residue you are trying to remove better (I think).The quality seems good and the price seems reasonable for what it is.', u'If you need an MF to use for removing excess water this is a good one to get.', u\"If you just need excellent quality MF for polish and wax removal I highly recommend (and own) these:3 Pack Cobra Miracle Towels, 16 x 24 inches.I've been a fan of Meguiar's for a long time but when GG's stuff becomes available on Vine I will usually try it out.\", u'They have a name for quality and as far as I can tell it is well deserved.', u\"I got this:Griot's Garage 11285 Spray-On Car Wash Kit- and it is excellent too.\", u'The three MFs that come with it are very high quality.', u'I have used this a few times after washing my car- it is basically an oversized drying shammy rather than a soft towel.', u\"The Pro's are the compact size and impressive ability to soak up water.\", u'The smaller size means its convenient to leave in your car for spot wipe down duties at the no touch car wash (even with the force air drying systems the good ones have, you are still looking at water spots if you don\\'t wipe the car down).The Cons include the instructions \"After squeegeeing\" please don\\'t squeegee your car!', u'Unless you enjoy scratched clearcoat (or worse- paint).', u'Forced air is the better approach according to most expert car detailers.', u'Also the towel won\\'t be enough to dry a \"wet\" car, you will need more than one microfiber towel (I normally plan to use several- then wash them together later).For the niche I use this for (in car stored spot drying towel), I really liked this shammy/towel.', u'But for primarily drying a completely wet car where you are not using air to dry the car off first, you may want to look at the microfiber towel bundles instead.', u'I had the chance to review this and I never have used microfiber towels, typically when washing our cars I use standard bathroom towels.This microfiber towel is really absorbent and soft.', u'With one swipe you are instantly able to dry and leave a streak free finish on your car.', u\"The towel also does great at cleaning the windows also leaving a streak free finish.The microfiber is much software then a standard towel and doesn't leave any little fibers behind.\", u'It works really well.', u\"The only thing I don't like about this towel is the price.\", u'I could see spending around $9.99 for it at the high end.', u\"But for $16.99 the current price as of 4/29/2013 I just can't justify it, unless they add a second towel to the pack.\", u'It does work, but there is a premium price on it in my opinion.', u'A little birdie told me that this would be a great towel.', u'I suggested to the bird that he was as crazy as I for even talking about it.', u\"It's fantastic!\", u'That bird hit it on the head with a clean blow.', u'A 16X14 size is just the right size for picking up a full load of sudsy warm water that is ready to apply to a shaded vehicle.', u\"The old Tahoe saw me coming with a bucket and a Griot's Microfiber Towel.\", u'It immediately knew what was coming:  a bath.', u'And a bath it got.', u'This towel keeps the liquid in its fabric so that the weight makes the initial cleaning simple and fast; much faster than a standard microfiber towel.', u'To get the full benefit from the towel I rinsed it as clean as I could and then began the wiping down of the surfaces with ease.', u'It really is every bit as good as any natural fabric (chamois) and even better than microfiber towels of lighter weight.', u'While it is close to chamois it performs the job better and it just handled better than the chamois.', u'I had a few dried spots that I used a natural sponge on to rejuvenate the surface with so I could do the job perfectly and the old Tahoe just purred for another wash job.', u'I considered using hand but reconsidered.This is one of those once a week job helpers that will multiply after using for the first few times.', u'I expect to add to my one soon.', u\"Seventeen bucks for a towel might seem expensive, but you get a lot of bang for your buck here.This towel is both thicker and larger than other towels I've used, measuring two feet on the long side.\", u\"While saying this can dry your whole car at once may be a bit of a stretch, with a few wring-outs it *will* be the only towel you need to use, as long as you're not soaking up everything as soon as you hose down the car.As microfiber, it's as soft as you would want it to be on your vehicle's finish, does an amazing job leaving a dry, streak-free finish, and I found it dries pretty quickly as well.\", u\"If you clean your own vehicle, this is a wise investment - you'll only have to worry about one towel for the who process.\", u\"I've been using Griot's Garage products for several years, and I've always found them to be at least as good as, and frequently significantly better, than what the competition can offer.\", u\"This one, though, seemed to be an oddity:  a towel that thinks it's a giant microfiber cloth?\", u'Well, it works:  it is highly absorbant, and it leaves none of the towel fuzz that can mar a good wash and wax.', u\"It's not really marketed this way, but it also works very well as a giant microfiber cloth for use in non-drying applications.\", u'Highly recommended!', u\"This towel is the softest and thirstiest towel I've ever used.\", u'I was able to completely dry an entire car with this towel alone.', u'And that is in the humid clime of Houston, TX.', u\"I have other Griot's Garage towels that I think very highly of, but this towel sets a new bar.First, this towel is so thick that it seems more like a mat than a towel.\", u'It has a plushness that feels squishy.Second, this microfiber towel is incredibly soft.', u\"Your car's paint is not going to suffer damage by this towel.Finally, this towel can take in a tremendous amount of water.\", u'One pass over a wet surface yields a complete dryness.', u'Not even a bubble of water remains.', u'I was really impressed and my first thought upon using was \"I\\'m buying my dad one of these for Father\\'s Day\".In my experience, Griot\\'s Garage generally makes quality products, but this one is at the top of my list.', u'The current price of $17 seems like a real bargain.', u'Highly recommended for \"car guys\".', u\"I didn't really believe I could wipe down my entire midsize car with this towel, but I can.\", u\"This towel works great, and I plan on buying another, and I've recommended it to a number of people.\", u'Simple thing; works great.', u\"I live in an area with really hard water, so not only do I have to worry about spots if I don't dry my car after a driveway wash, even the automatic car washes tend to leave spotty residue.\", u\"I've been using cheapest-you-can-get-me microfiber towels from a national chain of auto parts stores, with pretty good results, so I thought this would be a step up.In terms of feel, this towel is definitely thick, and almost chamois-like in texture.\", u'On the initial dry, it did a wonderful job, though, it did leave a few balls of fiber on my car.', u\"Griot's Garage makes pretty decent stuff (I'd argue it's at least as good, if not better than Meguiar's) and this towel continues their tradition of good quality.Sure, it sops up lots of water, but one of the things I desperately need this kind of product for, is cleaning around my windshield washer nozzles on my hood.\", u\"They never, ever get cleaned or dried properly, and if you're not using the right cloth, you can ruin a fresh car wash.Everything was great, but after washing it, something changed.\", u'I followed the washing instructions to the letter, but it seems that this towel leaves some streaks now.', u\"My cheap microfiber towels don't do that, and I've washed them the same way.\", u\"I like the towel so much, I'm going to pick upGriot's Garage 11078 Micro Fiber and Foam Pad Cleaner, and see if that gives my towel a new lease on life.\", u'This is a huge, very soft, very absorbent towel that can dry off a large car without having to wring it out.', u'I keep it in the trunk for quick touch ups after drive through car washes too.', u\"I make a habit of keeping a spare junk towel and a spray bottle of McGuires in my 94' Vette in case I happen to need to go through a quick car wash or encounter any unfortunate bird deposits.\", u\"I didn't want to invest in anything too pricey, so I've been using a $4.00 value towel from WalMart... until now.\", u'The difference between this towel and a run of the mill cotton towel is pretty incredible.', u\"For one thing, you won't end up with a sopping wet towel AND car-- this thing really dries the car fast.\", u\"Plus, its easy to wash and doesn't come apart in the washing machine.\", u\"I let it air dry since I've read that microfiber towels lose their magic if you put them through the automatic dryer.\", u'Definitely my go-to towel now.', u'We use a variety of microfiber towels around our house and in our garage.', u\"They're usually not thick, but they still work.\", u'This towel is super thick and works even better than traditional microfiber towels for wicking away the moisture after washing the vehicle.', u'Our water is really salty here, so we have to be very careful about completely drying vehicles after washing because the waterspots damage the paint if left to bake in the hot, desert sun.', u'This towel did a wonderful job of drying the entire vehicle and not leaving behind the nasty waterspots.', u'Because you can just throw it in the washer and dryer, there is no special care needed.', u\"(Just don't use fabric softener with it as that takes away some of its ability to absorb water.)\", u'You will want to make sure that you keep it clean as dirt particles can scratch the paint on a vehicle.', u'Straight out of the package, I used this to wipe down the inside of my windshield.', u'It removed the hazy, streaky mess left from my Windex attempt with ease.', u'Then, I used the towel to dry my car after washing.', u'Granted it was a hot day so the water drops were evaporating fast on their own, but I only had to wring out the towel twice to do the whole car, including windows.', u'The instructions say to run the towel through the washer/dryer to clean it if it becomes dirty.', u'I used to use \"The Absorber\" synthetic chamois, which is OK but I find this microfiber towel by Griot\\'s far superior.', u'Talk about absorbent AND soft.', u'This towel is both.', u'It\\'s probably 1/4\" thick and feels like two layers of microfiber cloth with a sponge core.', u'To see how absorbent it is, I filled a beaker (I actually had one lying around) with water.', u'The towel sucked up all 600ml.', u'When I removed the towel it dripped a little - but nothing like what I expected.', u'So this thing will dry anything FAST!', u'Wringing it out removes about 85% of the water.', u'This is a thick towel, almost like a chamois.', u'The microfiber is great, in that it eliminates streaks and absorbs a ton of water before it has to be wrung out.Very reasonably priced, too.', u\"I recommend it for the final wipe-down, after the car is clean and you just want to clean up the excess water and streaks.Sean P. Logue, 2013 I've been using a microfiber towel I purchased from Autogeek (it was OK, but nothing to get excited about).\", u\"The Griot's towel is thick, soft, almost luxurious.\", u\"My car is a dark reddish/purple changeable color and if you don't use the right towel on it, you see swirls and streaks.\", u\"I don't squeegee (in fact, I've never heard of doing that before), but this towel alone is enough to completely dry my car with no streaking.\", u\"You may think the price is a little high but this is on par with decent microfiber towels that aren't as plush and absorbent as this one.\"]\n"

My professional crimper was able to fold them but not close them tight on the wire, so out came the persuader - a 16 oz claw hammer and some cement.', u'Yep - that closed the crimp nice and snug on the wire.', u'Now it has a good snug grip.', u'I did buy some professional #4 lugs at the hardware store made of copper like a shiny penny and my professional crimper did those justice, so their lugs are a tad sub par but you can put them on with just about anything.', u'Alternately I could have hit it with a propane torch and fed some solder to it, which I may still do if there is excessive loss in the cable.', u'I prefer soldered connections wherever possible.I also bought some nice bolt on attachments at the hardware store for $2/pr that have a bar which snugs down with 2 ea 7/16 bolts and nuts on the back side.', u'Now that was a solid connection - I drove the bolts home with my dewalt 3/8\" impact driver and a 7/16 socket which grabbed the wire and would not let go, then gave me a big ring to tie to that did not look like someone pounded a crimp lug with a hammer on cement to make it grab!I realize copper is expensive these days but this stuff was recycled 2 or 3 times over.', u\"New copper wire shouldn't look like a 1960's penny under the couch.\", u\"It sure makes monster cable's oxygen free copper look bright and shiny by comparison.\", u'On the other hand, I did especially like the fact that the insulation is color coded properly, red and black.', u\"I have seen high current wiring kits where the wire's insulation is entirely black, entirely white, or some other way of not coding the positive and negative by insulation color.\", u'Even the space shuttle wiring is ENTIRELY white no matter what purpose it serves.', u'The only identification each white wire gets is a black wrapper with a 4 or 5 digit number that is referenced in the schematics.', u\"Nasa's wire is also silver plated copper and thus carries the same current of cruddy copper wire 1 size larger with the same loss and less weight at 10x the price.Other than the cruddy copper - it's a good value - you're getting 20 feet of #4 cable with precrimped lugs on one end and trimmable to length on the other end with a set of lugs you can pound onto the wire.\", u'It certainly has the heft of 20 feet of #4 too - this shipped at over 5 lbs, most of which was the 2 pieces of #4 cable.', u'It ran my inverter just fine so no harm.You also get a green ground wire to tie your inverter chassis to whatever ground you have, be it in a car or a ground rod in the earth.', u\"Like me you probably don't think you need a ground for a battery powered device - when wwas the last time you grounded your remote control?\", u'In theory ground wires should cary no current nor any voltage, but the spinning fan on the inverter can cause static electricity.', u'You do need to equalize any static charge buildup or leakage in capacitors, or alternately stray magnetic fields causing voltage in metalic parts.', u'Sure these are small voltages, between 0.5 and 2.0 V but they can flip a logic state if not returned to ground and also making troubleshooting a nuisance.', u\"While not absolutely necessary, if you don't ground it be sure that somewhere from the output path of the inverter to your load you have a GFCI plug.\", u\"That way if the current finds another path back to the battery or to the inverter chassis it will cut off power in a fraction of a second preventing electrocution - yours, not to mention damage to the equipment.Keep in mind that #4 wire can carry 100's of amps (approaching 1000 amps) and will do a nice job arc welding.\", u'Once you get this installed treat it with a great deal of respect.', u\"Don't be shocked (no pun intended) when you make the final connection if there is a SMALL arc - emphasis on SMALL - the reason is that there are capacitors in the inverters that help to smooth out the current flow and they charge instantly when power is applied.\", u'When finished, disconnect from the battery.', u\"Use some extra caution when using tools like crecent wrenches around  deep cycle batteries =  don't bridge to the other terminal.\", u\"I had an electrician drop a crescent wrench inside a pac bell phone central office onto the -48VDC buss bars that powered the building's phone switch.\", u\"It didn't even blow the fuse - just vaporized the wrench into sputter.\", u'We crawled down to the buss bars and there was nothing even resembling a wrench where it made contact with the -48VDC bars.', u'This product box even has a warning that if you are not familiar with high current wiring have someone who is do it.', u\"For the price these 4AWG cables can't be beat.\", u\"The image clearly shows what you're getting.\", u'I actually made a few jumper cables to connect batteries in parallel in my battery bank.', u'I bought extra ring terminals to make these jumper cables.', u'This is a good starter kit for setting up a basic inverter system.', u'All three cables appear to be made well.', u'The best thing about this product is the price.', u'You would be hard pressed making these cables yourself for the price.', u'I was surprised by the quality and beefiness of this kit.', u'I immediately cut it up to make some quick connectors and they work well.']\n"

shower and the toilet.7.', u'For most motorhomes with a single bathroom and shower, 1 2/3 gallons of antifreeze should be sufficient to protect all water supply lines and the pump.', u'The remaining antifreeze should be poured equally into in all of the sink traps, the shower trap and in the toilet to protect them from freezing.Some RV owners contend that just blowing out the water lines is enough to protect them from freezing.', u'That may be sufficient in mild climates.', u'However the leading RV manufacturers recommend that antifreeze be used to protect the water pump and those nooks and crannies where water may puddle in the plumbing even though it has been blown.', u'This entire winterizing process should not require more than about a half-hour.', u'What can i say?', u'When you have the right tool, the job is easy.', u'I got this to keep in the camper to use to blow down the water lines in that thing.', u'If you use this on your camper BE SURE to adjust your compressor regulator to no more than 30 psi to keep from popping your connections and causing yourself a ton of extra repair work.', u'I had a cheapo blow out plug that had a valve like on a tire...it meant holding the air hose up to the blow out plug while some faucet inside was open.', u'I used that stupid thing once...just once.', u'It was such a pain to go inside, open some faucet, go back outside, hold up the hose to the blow-out, wait a bit, then go do another one.So I picked up this one which has the quick-connect which works great with my compressor.', u'I just pre-set my compresser to 50 psi (I might stick to 40 psi next time...50 seemed a bit high and made water splatter alot).', u'Hooked it up, walked around inside the trailer opening/closing faucets without having to go back out and deal with anything.', u'Easy stuff.', u\"Don't know why I wasted any money at all on that old plug without the quick-connect.\", u\"If all you were doing was purging a single fixture, that's probably fine, but if you have an RV with more than one faucet, go this route.\", u'This product is well built but the concept does not work as well as I had hoped.', u'The brass fitting is solid and you can attach your air hose directly to it and not have to hold it.', u'That is a big benefit for a one person operation.', u'Be careful not to over pressurize the lines in your trailer or you can rupture them.', u'Did not blow out as much of the water as I had hoped so still put in the RV antifreeze.', u\"I think it is still a good idea because you don't have the antifreeze diluted as much by the water in the lines.\", u'Most of it is blown out.', u'I think this one is the best on the market and Amazon has them at a great price.', u\"I don't have an RV but do have property that sits idle in the winter.\", u'With some modified gear, I can use this to blow out water lines and water heaters and not be concerned with frozen and busted equipment.', u\"Around the house I can use this to blow out water lines for repair or rerouting or changing to different sized lines without making a mess right where I'll be working.I just wish I could find a connecter to fit this onto a regular water tap at the house without having to make something up myself.\", u\"It's Brass Blow Out Plug!!!\", u'Fool your friends!', u'Tease the dog!', u'Entertain the children for hours!', u\"It's a plug and it's made from an alloy of copper and zinc!\", u'With a higher malleability than bronze or zinc and a relatively low melting point of (900 - 940 C, 1652 - 1724 F, depending on composition, of course.', u')The name says it all.', u\"It's a sturdy, brass attachment that you screw into your water input line on a camper, attach an air hose and (THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT) OPEN ALL THE FAUCETS IN YOUR CAMPER BEFORE YOU TURN ON THE AIR!!!\", u\"Having stayed relatively awake during physics class, I understand the whole &#34;pressure blows stuff up&#34; concept, but the guy I saw at the gas station did not and blew out the PVC plumbing in his RV when he forgot to open any faucets and pumped that baby full of 110 PSI of pipe-bustin' air!\", u'The only thing more monumental than this camper faux pax was seeing everyone jump when it popped!Order two or three, they make great Christmas gifts!', u'There is absolutely no way to improve on this product.', u'Past 3 years I have blown the lines out in my RV rather than using antifreeze, and not a single problem.', u\"I'm VERY glad I bought this rather than putting that pink crap into my water supply.\", u'Very well made and sturdy.', u'If you own a camper or garden hose you need one.', u'I use this to blow out our camper lines every year and all of our garden hoses before freezing temps arise.It replaced a plastic one, that broke.', u'If you blow your garden hoses out early you can use them in freezing temps, then blow them out when finished, keeping them ready for the next use in freezing temps.', u'I used this product to blow out the water supply lines in our travel trailer.', u'We are new to camping and I wanted to make sure all of the water was out of the system.', u'The process went well and then all I had to do was pour rv antifreeze in the drains and toilet.', u'Simply plug in to the city water supply and hook your compressor up at about 40psi.', u'Makes winterizing a breeze.', u'As other reviews state, you may want to drill out the hole in the device to allow more air flow.', u'Just remember if you have to go a distance to your rv, use air hose.', u'If you have to run an extension cord to your compressor, it must be a heavy cord like # 12 or #10 not a light cord (#16 or #18).', u'The shorter the extension the better.', u'A long light cord and a heavy load may damage your compressor.', u'Read the specs on this in your compressor owners manual.', u'Works as advertised.', u'I drilled the hole out larger to allow more air to flow when the valves are open in the RV.', u'I also have a regulator on my compressor so I dialed down the PSI to not blow a line in the trailer.', u\"Also, don't forget to remove your water filter cartridge if its located inside - you can still blow the water out, but best to just remove and get a new one next season.\", u\"While you are able to blow a majority of the water out of the lines, you're still going to need some RV anti-freeze - you still have water in your sink and shower traps that doesn't drain and will freeze in the cold temps.\", u'works great with my motor home, I blew out the antifreeze in the lines before beginning the sanitizing process and again before loading with clear filtered water A good quality product.', u'It works as expected.', u'The threads work great, which was our biggest concern.', u'Not a sloppy fit at all.', u'We have had this product before and very successful.No negative comments on this product.We are very happy with our purchase.', u'This blow out plug makes winterizing our camper much easier and secure.', u\"The biggest challenge may be in making sure your air line pressure is below the recommended 40 psi, in order not to damage either the RV's lines or connectors.\", u'If this is not possible, get the blow out plug with the Schrader type air valve (similar to a tire valve).', u\"We were looking for this item and couldn't find it anywhere.\", u\"We've used it once, but are extremely happy with how well it works.\", u'Highly recommended.']\n"

don\\'t ape tighten it!The spray settings dial needs a firm twist to move from setting to setting, but it is easy to move once you get the hang of it and there is a very loud audible \"click\" when you properly move to the next setting.', u'The settings worked as noted (Flat, Center, Cone, Full, Mist, Jet, and Shower).', u'I like Full and Jet for car washing, and Shower for garden plant watering.', u'This spray nozzle does seem to manage water flow as intended; it does not produce the stronger jet of the different units we have, but it does not produce the weakest either.', u'Seems just about right for what it is intended to do.While seemingly not a nozzle that a commercial irrigation crew would carry on the job, it should be right at home when used for light duty household job.', u'Simple to use and effective.The Amazon sales page notes that Pretmanns does \"guarantee it for a full year against any defects in material and workmanship\"; however, the nozzle\\'s package clarifies that guarantee by confirming the timeline and further noting that a \"$3.50 fee will be charged for postage and handling\".', u'If an issue arises before the guarantee period expires, I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled.', u'We did receive this product gratis from the manufacturer and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed.', u'My statements here reflect that testing.If looking for a garden hose spray nozzle of this type, style, and construction, for use as described above, then we recommend this one based on our experience with it.Go for it.']\n"

      "[u'I recently ordered this 800 watt unit.', u'I liked the way its put together and all the saftey features the unit has.', u'I installed the inverter in battery area in motorhome.', u'I comes with 6 gadge cables.', u'I just cut off the clamps and hard wired to the battery itself and mounted to underside of RV floor near chassis and battery.', u'Inverer ran both... 22 inch flat screen and DVD player without much effort or much load on inverter.', u'The TV and DVD player and xbox is setup is off a 4 plug receptical in RV itself.I did not want to have to plug tv, DVD and etc from house 110 recepticals and inverter receptical everytime we stopped the RV for the night or few days or run these items through inverter all the time drawing on battery when I had house current available.So I ran and installed UL junction next to invertor with cover .', u'In the junction I ran up to TV cabinet 14ga 110 house wire.', u'I spliced heavy duty 3 wire 14ga cord into house wire in junction box and place heavy duty plug on end into inverter receptical.In Tv Cabinet in RV I ran this wire to a lighted household light switch so I can see when inverter was on battery compartment ( which was outside hidden in compartment) then to a 110 Toggle switch on one side of the toggle switch.On the other side of  toggle switch I connected to the 110 shore ....rv power (when RV is plugged into at campground).The output off toggle went to double recepticals by TV, DVD, Xbox etc would use.I maked the toggle house current on one side and Invertor on other side of toggle switch.Now instead of switching wiring back and forth or leaving inverter running off RV battery I simply toggle back and forth between both souces of 110 power.The toggle can handle 110 current.... left ON.... middle OFF ....right ONAlso both sources of power can never be on to recepticals at same time.', u\"Works great I have a 2000 watt Whistler inverter and am very happy with it (I wrote a review of it if you're interested).\", u'The 2000W version is part of a solution (package?', u'system?)', u\"I put together to supply power for a few items I'd like to have available in a power grid failure like a hurricane or an ice storm.Part of that solution is a pair of 12V batteries and a battery charger (NOCO Genius G7200).\", u'The batteries supply the power to the 2000 watt inverter.', u'The charger keeps them ready or, if the grid is down, recharges them.', u'My problem was how to supply power to the charger if I deplete the batteries and the grid remains down.Turns out my NOCO charger needs only 150 watts to charge the batteries.', u'This Whistler 800 watt inverter can provide that without breaking a sweat, and only needs 80 amps DC to provide it (actually, to provide 800 watts, not just the puny 150 watts my charger needs).', u\"My car's alternator provides 105 amps, way more than the Whistler 800 needs to max out.So I bought this item and now my car can power this 800W inverter that can easily and safely recharge the batteries that supply my 2000 watt inverter.\", u\"At the same time as it's charging the big guy, this 800W inverter has power to spare for lights and low-draw electronics (laptops, cell phones, cable/DSL modems, wireless routers, VOIP boxes, cordless phones, yada yada yada).You can buy the 400 watt version for a bit less if you like, but if your car will support the 800 watt version (80 amps minimum) why would you not opt for more power and flexibility for just a few bucks more?Nope, I don't work for these guys but I probably should :-)  And yes I'm a Viner but I paid for both this and the 2000w version and all the other goodies in that system.\", u'Whistler makes a good range of products here.', u'This power inverter is awesome.', u\"So, you are reading this waiting to find out what that one thing is...it's the stupid fuses.\", u'Whistler decided it was a good idea to put them on the inside of the inverter instead of making it easy to replace them on the outside of it.', u'But wait it gets better.', u'They are soldered in which makes it a PITA to replace.', u\"The reviews say they don't blow easily, unless you are an idiot and hook the pos and neg up backwards.\", u'Then you deserve to spend the time to re-solder new fuses in.', u'But seriously this is an outstanding inverter.', u'I have already used it a bunch of times using drills, sanders, and a dremel in the first week of getting it.', u'Other websites give a description saying it comes with 6 foot cables but thats combining both which are really 3 feet each (pos and neg).', u'The terminals are on the wimpy side but who cares, this thing kicks butt.', u'I wish it came with a digital display that shows the watts, volts, amps, etc like the larger units have.', u'Its a perfect size and has the tabs on the base to mount it to whatever tickles your fancy.', u\"Don't expect it to come with the cigarette attachment thingy.\", u'Its too big and will blow your vehicle cigarette outlet fuses.', u'Most people assume the mid size inverters come with it.', u\"They don't.\", u'Get over it.', u'Just use the alligator clamps and throw it on your battery or be a man and hard wire it into your rig.', u'Buy it right now.Edit...I just used this inverter to power a small George Foreman Grill!', u'The cables got a little warm so keep an eye on them.', u'Mmmmmm grilled cheese sandwich!!!', u'What else can I run on this thing?!', u'I have tested our CPAP machines (2) with a portable battery and it works great.', u\"Haven't tested how long the battery will last.\", u'Product looks good with battery connectors and built in fan.', u\"I'm using this with our solar panel battery bank.\", u'Comes with fairly long (~6 feet) alligator clamps.', u'This is a modified sine wave inverter so be careful powering sensitive equipment like laptops, power tool chargers, printers, etc...']\n"

      "[u\"This was my first steam cleaning machine and I wish I didn't wait so long to find out how useful they are.\", u'You can clean and sanitize so many surfaces without using any cleaning products so it is great for the pocketbook and the environment.', u'Floors are a breeze and because it leaves them barely wet they dry in no time.Overall the HomeRight Steam Machine is well designed, easy to use and has attachments for a large variety of chores.', u'I like that there is a compartment on the machine to store all of the smaller attachment and adapters.', u'If you fill it with 40oz.', u'of water it will produce steam for 45 minutes but also included in the manual is the information that 26oz.', u'will run for 30 min and 13oz.', u'for 15 minutes.', u'That is handy when you just want to do a small job.', u'It takes only about 8 minutes for it to heat up.I had one particular chore in mind when I ordered this steamer.', u'My 2005 Weber Performer grill had years of baked on grime inside the kettle and I had just been cleaning the grate with a wire brush so it needed some attention too.', u'It did a great job and there is no better way to clean your grill grate than steam and the included brass brush.', u'You can order replacement brushes and attachments directly through the HomeRight web site.There is one flaw in the design though, the handle has a ribbed hard plastic grip that is uncomfortable and it is best if you wear a work or rubber glove if using for an extended period.', u'That is the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.', u'The manufacturer really needs to redesign that.', u\"Let's go over some of the basics of this machine.It provides steam.\", u'Steam can be very helpful in the cleaning/removal of a lot of things.', u'It comes with a lot of attachments, and some general attachments as well.', u'We found the floor attachment to basically just heat/dampen a microfiber cloth, not really that great.', u'However the wallpaper removal one has had good success, as well as a few of the more general tips/extensions.It does take a few minutes to heat up, and then needs to be emptied after use.', u'It should also be noted that distilled water is recommended to be used, although the manual says that other water can be used (in our case we have a reverse osmosis filter, so we used that).My biggest complaint is storage of all the accessories.', u\"Some fit in the machine, which is great, but a lot don't, and combined with the hose, etc it means you kind of have a mess wherever it is sitting.It's a good cheap way to get steam power for cleaning, and if you have tile/stuck wallpaper/annoying stains, it might help you out.\", u'I was wary about the ability of the HomeRight C800880 SteamMachine On-Demand Power Steamer and Wallpaper Remover when I got this considering my previous experience with a brand-named steam cleaner (my reviews for a McCulloch MC1246 Portable Steam Cleaner) which was disappointing.', u'And was I wrong!', u'The HomeRight C800880 was right on the money when you need an efficient, high-performance steam cleaner.', u'For those shunning away from chemical cleaners, steam is the ONLY alternative to give you an all-around cleaning initiative.', u'The HomeRight C800880 gives you the results you need from a powerful steam cleaner that holds and maintains the high temperature and superheated status of the steam.My impressions:Power: the 1500-watts boiler of the HomeRight C800880 gives you the steam power you need to tackle a variety of cleaning jobs.', u'Soap scums and hard water stains in the bathroom and kitchen, \"baked-in\" grime on your stovetop and oven, goes away like it wasn\\'t there.', u\"What's amazing is that the HomeRight C800880 was able to maintain the superheated status of the steam thereby save you time in your cleaning chores because the boiler is powerful enough to give you very hot steam in an extended period of time.\", u'The waiting in-between for the machine to build up pressure to create very hot steam is minimized.Portability: the HomeRight C800880 is light and small enough to be carried or pulled around your home where you need it to tackle your cleaning chore.', u'The wheels and the handles gives you the mobility you need to move around with the steamer to tackle your cleaning jobs with minimal difficulty.Attachments: the HomeRight C800880 has a complement of attachments to address a variety of cleaning chores: a nylon brush, a brass brush, wallpaper steam plate, floor steam mop with cleaning cloth, a squeegee and a jet nozzle.', u'The 8-feet hose and the 8-feet power cord is long enough to give you that reach to accomplish your task with minimal movement of the main steam unit.', u'You are pretty much covered regardless of where you want to clean and sanitize in your home.For its size and weight, the HomeRight C800880 packs a cleaning power packs power comparable to other similar, larger units.', u'Although the manual stated that the waiting time for this unit to build up steam is 8 minutes, I found that 10-12 minutes of waiting time builds more pressure and the steam more super heated to give you a much more powerful cleaning objective.', u'Very pleased at this little steamer.', u'It has exceeded my expectations in every way.', u\"The manufacturer got it right with the HomeRight SteamMachine - and ours gets a workout throughout the year.It's very simple to setup - just add water and plug it in.\", u\"There is an attachment for practically every chore I need it for:* Cleaning the tile floors (we have two wild dogs)* Cleaning my BBQ grill* Cleaning the glass of the pellet stove in winter* Cleaning the stove (inside and out)* Cleaning the bathrooms - bathtubs, showers, sinks, floorsThe unit is compact and light, so it's easy to move about the house.\", u'But it delivers high-pressure power that cleans every surface put to task.', u'A very well-made, well-designed little steamer.', u'This is one cool machine, definitely one of my favorite cleaning tools.', u'I have not used it for wallpaper yet, only for cleaning but I am so pleased with it.', u'I have cleaned sinks, toilets, doors, showers, floors.', u'It came with a very detailed, illustrated manual so it was easy to get it ready for use.', u'It has lots of attachments to use and they are both illustrated and described in the manual so you know what they are for.', u'Strong pressure and I was surprised how long you can use it before having to refill the tank.', u\"I haven't even had to refill it on the projects I've used it for because they've all been under 30 minutes and I still had water to go when finished that I ended up draining before storing it.\", u\"My spouse started using it willy nilly without reading the manual on what not to use it on and ended up stripping the paint off a door that didn't have a finish on it...so pay attention to what surfaces to avoid using it on (the manual details this).I would highly recommend this steam machine.\", u'Excellent Product:Tackles all of our cleaning challenges with great results.Pros:  Great to clean kitchen stains, rug stains, bathroom stains and even hard water stains.', u'Great set of attachments.Cons: Not many to speak of...if you follow the directions it works 100% perfectly.', u'Product does make you wonder how long it will last...but time will tell that.Our story is quite simple...we live in a home with 8 people and a small dog.', u'Things can get messy.', u'On top of that we have well water which is hard and destroys most of our faucets and shower heads.', u'Third, we cook a lot Indian food which can stain kitchen cabinets and tile caulk pretty easily.We first wanted to attack our kitchen...since we spend a lot of time in there.', u'Again, we cook a lot of Indian food and it can get quite messy and does stain almost everything it touches due to turmeric.', u'Our kitchen cabinets, unfortunately, are white.', u'We basically attached the included scrubbing brush and went to town on our cabinets.', u'While the stains did not disappear 100%, I can safely say that 90% of them were removed without scratching the surfaces.', u'EXCELLENT.Second - we decided that we would try this on the hard water build up around our shower heads (cheaper then replacing them)...much to our surprise this thing pulverized the calcium build-up and our shower heads were almost new again.', u'It also aided in removing the hard water spots that occur on faucets and shower doors... EXCELLENT.Third - rugs - dog - accidents - kids - accidents - stains :) - Yep...we hit all of our major spots on our carpets and I can say we had about 80% success there without using any chemicals.', u'Very Good.', u'I cannot blame the steamer because some of those stains are quite old and probably permanent at this point.Overall - with the quality of this machine, the included accessories, and the fact that the pressure is right and the thing cleans..I give it 5 stars.', u'Excellent.']\n"

      "[u\"This leather care spray works alot better than I thought it would after using it, but it's essentially designed for leather maintenance and isn't going to add life to old leather that's truly worn and dirty.\", u\"I ended up trying this on three different surfaces, the first being our ten year old vehicle upholstery, our 6 year old sofa that supports five large dogs, and a new leather chair.The solution sprays on lightly, almost like water, and helps to losen surface dirt, but even with a good rub down with a terry cloth, it's not up to the challenge of dissolving ground in dirt.\", u\"I was expecting something a little more creamy to help condition and smooth leather, but the watery treatment does appear to work, although not as well as thicker solutions I've used.\", u\"The conditioners took a while to absorb, but after about 10 minutes or so, it's does, and the leather feels softer and looks shinier, but is completely dry to sit on.Last but not least, I've seen reviews that the smell is a little off and I have to admit, I can't identify what the smell actually is, but it's definitely not unpleasant.\", u\"It's a very light clean smell, inspired by new car leather, but doesn't quite capture the essence.\", u\"Overall, it's a good all purpose leather cleaner, but best for new leather or general leather maintenance and not reviving or conditioning older leathers.\", u'On dark, matte-finish leather, the application of this product is rather fussy.', u\"It's best used in very small areas at a time.\", u\"After spraying and rubbing and drying with another dry cloth, you'd best be prepared to take a new, dry cloth and rub the leather a little more, otherwise, you'll be able to see every stroke you made with the first two cloths when the light hits the leather just right, and that's almost worse than just having dirty, unconditioned leather.\", u'This is one or two more steps than I have patience for, at this point in my life, especially when there are products out there that are just spray, wipe and go.However, I like this product for dark leather with a shiny finish.', u'It is spray, wipe, and go ease on this kind of leather.', u'It makes quick work of cleaning and conditioning my living room furniture, and makes it just gleam.', u\"I've been using Lexol leather care products for at least a couple of decades, and I remenber my Dad using them on leather goods when I was a kid some 50 years ago.\", u'This is the first time I have tried a one-step, all in one Lexol product, having always used the separate Lexol cleaner and Lexol conditioner.', u'I tried the \"3-in-1\" spray on the leather seats of my Bimmer, using a slightly damp wax applicator sponge and a terry cloth towel to remove the excess and buff, per the product instructions.', u\"It's very easy to use, does not leave a greasy residue, and seems to clean and feed the leather nicely, buffing to a nice satin sheen.Don't expect the same rich, creamy conditioner, or the same deep cleaning you will get using the two step Lexol products - or the great, fresh-tanned leather aroma that the traditional Lexol conditioner gives to leather.\", u'Unlike another reviewer, I did not find the aroma of the 3-in-1 offensive - more like inoffensively non-descript.', u\"This spray on, combination product doesn't strike me as a substitute for periodic cleaning and conditioning with the traditional Lexol two step method.\", u'However, it does seem to provide an easy way to keep leather supple and looking good between regular Lexol cleaner and conditioner treatments.', u\"It's a nice addition to the old standbys in the Lexol line of leather treatments.You will pay a price for convenience, however: this 16 oz spray bottle costs about as much as a full liter of Lexol conditioner.\", u'Still strikes me as a worthwhile product.', u'Lexol is a great product for cleaning and conditioning leather.', u'I clean my office chair weekly and this did a good job.', u'Only minor complaint is the spray splatters a little bit when you try to spray it onto a rag.', u'I would recommend this easy to use product for anything leather: car seats, saddles, leather clothing, etc.', u\"I'm always apprehensive that these sprays will leave a greasy residue on the surface.\", u'Not so here.', u'It cleans and protects without any residue at all.', u'Overall, seems to be worth the money.', u'This is a premium product for those who have a strong desire to car for their leather seats.', u'Similar to when armor-all first hit the market, this product applies very well.', u'Although it is pricey, it is designed for true leather seats.', u'I applied some on my Audi and the shine was brilliant.', u\"It is a bit concentrated so you don't need as much as you probably use with similar products.\", u'Instead of have several care products....Leather, Rubber Trim, Dash Board, etc., this product is designed for many finishes.', u'So far, so good.', u'The office chair I use at home is leather.', u\"I admit I've been remiss in cleaning it properly for quite a while, and have been very lucky so far.\", u'But I realized that I really needed to start caring for the leather properly if I want it to last a long time.I researched leather cleaners, and the Lexol brand seemed to be the best available.', u\"When Amazon presented it to the Vine Voices for review, I didn't hesitate to choose it since I was already planning on buying it.The Lexol 3-in-1 Leather Care Spray was easy to use.\", u'You just spray it on, massage it into the leather, then wipe it off after a bit.', u'Voila!', u'The leather on my chair looked shiny and luxurious and felt great.', u'I was afraid it might be greasy or slippery but it is not.I am very pleased with the way Lexol cleaned my chair and will definitely buy more when this bottle runs out.', u'This is fantastic leather cleaner.', u\"I've used leather cleaners before and not one has come close to matching the quality of this one.\", u'It actually makes the leather look cleaner and softer.', u'I used it on the 3 rows of leather seats in the SUV and on the two leather recliners before emptying it.', u'Each SUV seat (all leather, no plastic) was so much cleaner and the rags proved it.', u'The second row is the dogs area and they really appreciated a new surface to dirty up.', u'The recliners had some surface dirt on the bottoms thanks to dogs wiping their faces on it but with Lexol the dirt was eliminated with almost no effort.', u'This is a really great product and it will become a staple in the car care box along with the other items.', u\"Frankly, Lexol's tire treatment is a disappointment; therefore, I was anticipating the worst when I obtained their leather-care product.\", u'Oh, boy, what a pleasant surprise!', u\"I've tried many of the commonly available leather treatments on a couple of classic cars (as well as on shoes, for which they generally are not recommended).\", u'The Lexol 3-in-1 cleans and, because of its oil base, penetrates leather.', u\"You're left with a nice shine and suppleness.\", u\"Because of the change of season, it's difficult to tell how well it will hold up to full sun and high temperatures, but it seems promising...\", u'It has taken me some time to write a review for the Lexol 3-in-1 Leather Care Spray, because I wanted to be sure and put it through its paces and give the product a good real-life evaluation before doing so.', u'For years, I have used a competitive product with which I was always generally satisfied.', u\"I compared the Lexol side-by-side with the other product I've used previously, not so much to pit one against the other (though that is inevitible), but to compare Lexol to what was my baseline expectation for a leather cleaner/conditioner.The first thing that one might notice with Lexol is the odor of the product.\", u\"I would be less than forthcoming if I didn't say it is borderline offensive.\", u'Though the smell did put me off, I persisted using the product both on automotive leather and household leather.', u'My observations are listed below, but my overall opinion after some good evaluation is very favorable.', u'I may just switch and buy Lexol from now on.CLEANING -  The first important thing we need this product to do is to CLEAN the leather, right?', u'While I will often pre-clean badly soiled leather with a mild soap and water and dry before using a leather care product, I tested the Lexol without any pre-clean to see what it has to offer.', u'I was pleasantly surprised at the general effectiveness of cleaning ground-in dirty leather.', u'I found that for heavily soiled areas, if you spray the Lexol on and let it soak in for a minute or so, then agitate gently with a microfiber cloth, it does a very good job of lifting the dirt out of the grain.', u'I have ivory colored leather furniture that I allow my German Shepherd to lie on, and believe me - it gets dirty!', u'It cleans as well as any spray-on product I have used.ODOR -  As mentioned above, this really bothered me at first.', u'It does not have what I consider a pleasant smell.', u'Okay...', u'I think it stinks (there, I said it).', u'This is subjective, and others may mind it more or less than I do - but I would prefer a nicer smell.CONDITIONING -  The conditioning properties seem to be good.', u'Lexol leaves the leather soft and suple and it retains that quality for quite some time.', u'One thing I like a lot about Lexol compared to some other brands, is that it leaves the leather with \"grippy\" natural feel - not slippery like many others do.', u\"Particularly when it comes to the leather seats in my cars, I don't want to slide around on them.\", u'I want them to grip me like leather is supposed to - and Lexol provides this feel very well.', u'During evaluation, I used the Lexol on one leather sofa cushion and another spray-on leather cleaner/conditioner on the adjacent cushion.', u'The results of the way the surface is left was remarkable.', u'The \"other product side\" was quite slippery, while the Lexol side was nice and \"grippy\" (but not tacky).', u\"The leather that we have is the rougher, what I call 'unpolished' but is really full grain leather.\", u\"It doesn't have the high shine of top grain leather so this product definitely worked differently.I tried this on an ottoman that had a few stains (pen, a glass mark) and lots of general use wear.\", u'I did test it in a discreet area first and knew going into it that it would leave it slightly darker.', u'With that in mind, I used it on the entire top of the ottoman.', u'It sank in really quickly and was much darker.', u'I really had nothing to wipe off since the leather soaked it all up.', u'But my rag had some discoloration with may have come from the leather dye - although it was very minimal.', u'The end result is that the ottoman has dried to a slightly darker version and evened out some of the stains but has not removed them.', u'I would have been amazed if they did come out since they had really penetrated.', u\"Overall, the leather looks in better condition, like it's been given a good drink after being thirsty.\", u'Which is probably what has happened!I believe it will work better on a top leather surface and in using it on smaller leather products, it has done a good job.', u'This is a no brainer for car leather seats.Use this one.', u\"It cleans (though maybe not as clean as those dedicated for the job), but I have some stains that I got rid off by using this one.It conditions my leather seat but I don't know about softening.Honestly, I've ran through a couple of bottles of these leather care sprays on my leather seats (all of my cars have leather seats, I like them because they are easier to clean than fabric.)\", u\"And I really don't see any short term benefits.\", u'I can see long term benefits because by using them, you keep the leather conditions to be shiny and soft.', u\"But for the driver seat which takes the most abuse, it can't get rid of the wrinkles from daily abuse.It's a good bottle.\", u\"It handles easy and sprays well, maybe a bit too much per squirt, but you need to wipe it down with a cloth.I usually leave it in without wiping for like 20 min and come back and wipe it off evenly.I recommend this product but I think it's a bit expensive.\", u'I think something like this should be in the $5-7.99 price range.', u'I had been using a separate cleaner and conditioner/protector on my car interior.', u'When I saw a product that was all three of these in one I jumped at the chance to lose a few steps and save some time.', u'Plus, I would be more likely to clean the car seats if it was an easier job.The product was easy to use, just spray it on, rub it in and wipe it off.', u\"The leather retained a soft, shiny look to it and didn't feel greasy.\", u'The smell was mild.', u\"My seats were not grimy, only dirty with normal wear, so I can't comment on whether or not this would work on really ground in dirt but it worked fine on everyday dirt.I only used a small amount of the bottle to clean the car so I had plenty left over to test other items.\", u'I asked my husband to try it on the leather saddle bags on his Harley motorcycle.', u'He was pleased with the results but wondered whether the protector would offer any resistance to rain.', u\"The bottle didn't say so I'll report back if he gets caught in a storm.\", u'Then I tried it on an old, dull looking pair of leather shoes and it made them look shiny and new.', u'Even if I need to clean them every few weeks to keep the shine it will be worth it as this cleaner is so easy to use it only took a minute per shoe.For the price, results and ease of use I would recommend giving this cleaner a try.', u'I tested this product on my office chair, leather car seats and our leather sofa.', u'It very quickly removes surface dirt & grime.', u\"I'm not crazy about the sprayer on this bottle, simply because you really can't spray this and control where it goes this is very thin & liquid-y, so I sprayed this onto my cloth to apply.\", u\"I'm not crazy about the smell, but its not a deal-breaker.\", u'Its just an oddly unpleasant scent, fortunately its not overpowering.', u'After a few minutes be sure to go back over each surface with a clean dry cloth, as the instructions state, it really made a difference in the final condition.', u'Lexol is one of those products that has been in my clean-up bucket for the past 20 years.', u'Ever since I purchased a car with leather seats, I have had Lexol products to care for the leather.If you are like me, you have chemicals for washing the car, treating the paint finish, treating the rubber, the tires, the chrome, and glass.', u'Each product has a specific purpose and each is suited for the part of the car being treated.Lexol also comes in a two-step configuration - one bottle for cleaning and conditioning, and another for preserving.', u\"This product makes it a one-step job to clean and preserve your leather.If you don't have time to do the two-step process, this is a good way to maintain your leather and save some time!\", u'I think this product is great for most vehicles and lots of other uses.', u'It does a great job of both cleaning and conditioning leather at the same time.', u'If you need a quick clean and condition then I would recommend this product.', u'But for a longer term solution, I would use a dedicated leather preservative/conditioner instead.', u\"While I do like this Lexol 3-in-1, I don't use it on my treasured vehicles that I only drive occasionally.\", u'For those vehicles I use a more expensive top grade leather preservative.I do use this for quick cleanup and conditioning on my regular vehicle that I drive mostly every day.', u\"I do not use it on the steering wheel rim as I don't want to take the chance of it getting too slippery.\", u'You definitely need to go back over the leather with a dry cloth to remove some of the slipperiness.It does work really great on boots!', u'Cleans them, conditions and gives the boots a nice shine.', u\"You don't have to use this Lexol 3-in-1 just for vehicles.This Lexol 3-in-1 is an excellent value and one bottle will last quite awhile.\", u\"I needed to have a Leather cleaner for my GTO's seats and looked around searching for best products.\", u'The Lexol 3-in- 1 Leather Care spray looked inviting so I gave it a try.', u'It has worked better than I expected and my seats are clean, soft, and smell great.', u\"Very good product and I'd buy it again when needed.\", u'Usually I use saddle soap to care for my leather products.', u'I applied this to the leather seating areas in an older car.', u'It improves the appearance, smells nice, and does not make things too slippery.', u'It would be nice if it created that \"new car smell\" and also would be nice if it could take out some of the more ingrained markings.', u'Overall, though, I was very pleased with Lexol 3 in 1 leather care.', u'It did very well given the age and condition of the leather.', u'As far as cleaning, though, saddle soap does a better job.', u'Since Lexol is specifically formulated for car upholstery it may do better in the long run.', u'I also used it during the colder months around here and it may work better in the summer.', u'4 1/2 stars for this.', u'I would have given 5 stars if it beat saddle soap in the cleaning category.']\n"

      "[u'The inside of my Jeep Grand Cherokee is black leather.', u'As much as I love the black leather and the interior of my Jeep, dust might as well be neon and flashing with as well as it shows up on the surfaces.', u'I try to keep ahead of it, but over the winter, it was cold, and I got lazy.', u\"By rights, before taking Griot's Garage 11259 Leather Care Spray Kit for a spin, I should have vacuumed the seats, dash, cupholders, inside panels of the doors- you know.\", u\"But it's still kind of nippy outside, and I was just lazy.Because it's been a little while since I cared for my car interior, and a little bit of grubbiness was also showing, along with the dust (I'd blame this on my toddler, but I'm messier than she is), I used the cleaner first, like the instructions say for especially soiled areas.\", u'The bottle of cleaner in this kit is good-sized.', u'I used it liberally and also used the included microfiber cloths.', u'I have lots of microfiber cloths at home, and these are on par with the rest of my microfiber cloth collection, but I think you can\\'t have too many of these cloths, since they get \"borrowed\" for other household chores, or wind up up at the garage.', u'The microfiber cloths clean well.', u'I was able to get into the crevices with just the cloth and my hand.', u'This cleaner works well on leather, plastic, and fabric.', u\"It even isn't a tragedy if you accidentally get some on your windows.\", u'It buffs right off windows, no streaks.', u\"I probably could have gotten really particular and used a cotton swab to get into the really tight spaces, but I didn't take the time to do so today, and the Jeep still looks practically new inside!Like I said, it's been a little while since I've taken care of the inside of my car- pre-winter, we're talking.\", u'So of COURSE I used the leather care spray in the smaller spritz bottle.', u\"It looks really milky and viscous in the bottle, and the instructions say to spray it onto a microfiber first, and then apply it to the perfed leather, which I do have on my seats, so that's what I did.\", u\"On the areas that aren't perforated, though, I spritzed directly on the leather, and that was fine, too.\", u'I wanted to make sure the dash area was really conditioned, so I gave the entire interior a once-over with the conditioner, and went back to give the dash a second helping.', u\"The interior gleams now!As for the smell, the cleaner doesn't really have much of a smell, and that's fine.\", u\"The leather conditioner has a good smell- there used to be a store at the mall I frequented as a kid called Wilson's Leather.\", u\"When I'd walk by that store, it smelled like rich leather.\", u\"This leather conditioner smells just like that.I'm really happy with the way this kit performed on the interior of my car.Now, I also have a leather motorcycle jacket I've worn all winter.\", u\"I wipe the outside with a damp-dry cloth when I need to, but I figured the leather on it seems similar to the leather in my Jeep, and that jacket's been out in the elements all winter long, so I used the cleaner and conditioner on my leather jacket, and it worked great on it, too.\", u\"I know I could get a product made just for leather jackets, but the Griot's worked just fine on it, and I had the Griot's out, anyway.\", u\"And I think it's fun to find a two-fer use out of a product.I still have a lot of this product left, too.\", u\"As it gets warmer, there'll be no excuses for not keeping my Jeep's leather interior well-conditioned and well-taken-care of!\", u'If you have been around vintage cars, you know that they are the best advertisement for taking care of leather.', u'As someone who not only has a vintage car but vintage saddles, I pooh poohed most leather products for cars.', u'I have used my saddle conditioner on the leather and found it superior.', u'The important thing with leather is cleaning without drying it out and losing the flexibility.', u'This is a car product that gets it.', u'We have used it on an old Lincoln with leather seats and they feel like new.', u'My skepticism went away quickly.', u'Follow the simple directions and the results are great.', u'Somehow they have incorporated a new car smell without a perfume sensation.', u'My husband was thrilled with this package and now we each have our own leather products.', u\"I am a car fanatic, and I have used practically every leather care product on the market as well as a host of Griot's products.\", u'I will review each of the components individually.', u\"Overall, my score is 4 stars.First, I'll say that one of the best features of Griot's products, in general, is the packaging.\", u'For example, the Interior Cleaner comes in a nice wide-base round bottle with a good sprayer (more later).', u\"When you are detailing a car, I can't stand cheap bottles with junky sprayers that are thin and fall over easily.\", u'Often, you are carrying multiple things in your hands and need to rest the bottle down on something and having it fall over all the time and dribble out is annoying.', u'All the bottles are very high quality and clear so you can see how much is left and where the end of the pickup tube is.This kit contains 8oz of the Leather Care Spray and a separate pump spray nozzle.', u'I was quite surprised by the Leather Care Spray.', u'It is an excellent regular-use cleaner and conditioner.', u'It leaves a very nice leather smell as well.', u'I would recommend it for leather that has been well maintained and in good condition.', u'What I REALLY like about this is that it does NOT leave a greasy, sticky mess behind like most other leather products.', u'A little goes a long way.', u'If your leather is in bad condition, look for something more like Leatherique.', u'The pump spray delivers a well-controlled fine mist, although sometimes it felt like it got stuck and I had to press extra firm.This kit contains 35oz of the Interior Cleaner and separate trigger spray nozzle.', u'Like the Leather Care Spray, both bottle and spray are packaged separately and sealed so that there are no leaks.', u'The sprayer is a very high quality and delivers a large volume per pump, but I found the spray pattern to be a bit large and often this led to overspray which I had to wipe over previous areas.', u'Like the Leather Care Spray, the Interior Cleaner is a mild, regular use product.', u'I used it on everything from leather, vinyl, to plastics, to even touch screens.', u'It was fairly all purpose and cleaned mild dirt well.', u'It did not remove heavy duty stains like some sunscreen on black leather, but that was to be expected.', u'This is not a miracle product, but an everyday maintenance product.', u'I felt this cleaner is a bit on the expensive side, but you can also buy a gallon refill bottle.', u'If you are really cheap, you can make your own refill and just use the excellent bottle.', u'It has a good amount of surfactants and did not leave streaking.Lastly, this kit contains four 16\" x 16\" green microfiber towels.', u'I would rate these towels as a \"basic grade\".', u'I have a LOT of much higher quality ones that I use for paint waxing, etc., but a good basic towel like this is better suited to the task at hand.', u\"Can't fault them for that as it would just make the kit more expensive.\", u\"I also have much cheaper MF towels.In sum, this is a good kit for routine maintenance on well-cared-for interiors, and the bottles are nice and Griot's makes larger refills for the leather and cleaner sprays.\", u'If you are expecting some super heavy duty miracle worker products, then I think you will be disappointed.', u\"A word about Griot's products.\", u'While never cheap, the overall quality and ease with which these products can be utilized makes them stand out.', u'The instructions are carefully written and the behavior and tactile feel of the products is rarely less than exemplary.', u'They just work well, as advertised.So, as expected.. the cleaner dissolved some fairly nasty, well-baked-in material from my \"leatherette\" dash cover and door panels - working better than the interior cleaners I\\'ve sampled in the past.', u'While some stains in the carpets would not release, I was surprised by how many spots *did*.On the leather, the cleaner removed dirt while leaving the surface uniform in color and texture.The leather conditioner resulted in a more more supple feel and a nice smell.', u\"Unfortunately, it's not going to fix scratches - which I begrudgingly admit is normal patina for a leather seat.\", u'Careful use, and regular maintenance of your leather - over many years - is the only way to avoid the typical rips and tears of a dryed-out leather seat.', u\"I've got a 2008 prius with leather seats, and I'm pretty sure the last time it got a good going-over was a car wash in 2009.\", u'While I typically keep the windows up, I also live in a rural area in drought, so with all the dirt roads, there is always a ton of dust.', u'So I had a pretty dirty job ahead of me.I used the cleaner and the cushy microfiber cloths on the textured dash, doors, console, and leather seats, and the combination of cleaner and cloths did an excellent job cleaning and conditioning every surface.', u'It was quick, easy work.', u'I was really impressed at how little effort and how little product I had to use.After cleaning the leather (and frankly, I was surprised at how beatifully the same leaner for the grimy dash worked on the leather--it even removed some kind of residue I was sure was a stain on the leather armrest), I used the conditioner on the leather, spraying directly on the solid leather and with a cloth on the perforated leather, as directed.It all looks awesome.', u'The only thing not covered is the glass, which of course got streaky and needs a shot of windex.The cloths are really nice, not the cheap, thin microfiber you usually see.', u'And the scent is very light, not at all bothersome even though I was using it in a closed car.', u\"ThisGriot's Garage 11259 Leather Care Spray Kitis just an outstanding product.The interior cleaner is simply the best I have ever used.\", u'It was able to remove grime from the leather seats of my nine-year old car that I would not believe was there had I not cleaned the seats myself.', u'In fact, it removed \"cooked\" grime from a vinyl dashboard after just using another brand\\'s cleaner.', u\"The sprayer is top quality too and reusable, so the next time just get the refillGriot's Garage 11104 Interior Cleaner - 35 oz..The leather care spray is just another milder cleaner and conditioner that leaves (what my nose believes is) the original fresh leather smell of the seats.\", u'I could just sit in the car for hours smelling away :-).', u'This stuff can make a common man (or woman) a leather fetish!This is it.', u'I finally found the holly grail of leather cleaners.', u'This is a quality product and designed for the person who takes pride of ownership in their car.', u\"Or, for the person who wants to improve the look of their leather or leather-type part of the car.I have several Audi's and the product applies very good.\", u'It comes with 4 quality cloths, which are nice size and perfect to apply the product.', u'The \"new car\" spray is excellent as it does freshen things up and is a better alternative to products such  as ammoral.Prior to using this product I used Meaguire\\'s, however this brand and the experience I have received might justify making a permanent switch.', u\"Plus, I noticed Griot's has a full line of car detail products, which is great for DIY'ers like myself.\", u\"I've been using Griot's Garage products pretty much exclusively for the past 4-5 years for a couple of hobby cars I own, as well as for my daily driver.\", u\"Like everything else in the company's cleaning, waxing, and protecting lines the Leather Care Spray Kit is excellent.\", u\"The cleaner and the leather treatment spray do exactly what Griot's Garage claim they do, and the microfibre cloths that come with the kit are also suitable for using with the company's waterless car wash, the spray on wax, and any type of glass cleaner you'd care to use.\", u\"I'm not entirely convinced that the ratio of interior cleaner to leather care spray is going to be perfect for everyone, especially since the leather care spray also cleans to a certain extent.\", u\"Even if there's still quite a bit of interior cleaner left, though, it is a product that can be used on a wide range of surfaces, so there will always be a need for it.\", u'Highly recommended products and a useful packaging idea for three products that can work in conjunction with each other.', u\"I have used Griot's Garage products for years - almost exclusively for my cars of course.\", u\"But for some reason I had never used the Griot's Leather Care.\", u\"I have several other leather cleaners/conditioners in my cabinets, so I suppose I just figured I'd wait until I was low before giving it a try.Well, I finally did give it a try - as part of the Leather Care Spray Kit.\", u\"First, here's what the kit contains:- 32 oz.\", u'of Griot\\'s Interior Cleaner- Griot\\'s \"Finest Sprayer\" for the above (a very nice adjustable sprayer by the way)- 8 oz.', u'Leather Care spray bottle (sprayer is included)- 4 microfiber towels (appoximately 12\" square)I have had the Interior Cleaner in my inventory of Griot\\'s products for some time, so I am familiar with using it - and it works very well.', u'But I had never really used it much on leather (mostly on the plastic and vinyl interior parts).', u'Seeing that it was part of this kit - and obviously intended to be used on leather - I gave it a try.', u'Works great!', u'!Using the Interior Cleaner, and the green microfiber towel, I chose a formidable test area: a ivory leather couch... that my dog lays on.', u'It gets filthy!', u'I mean right down into the grain of the leather filthy.', u\"I usually clean with gentle soap and water and lots of elbow grease... and even then it never seems quite as clean as I'd hoped.\", u\"The Griot's Interior Cleaner made much shorter work of the dirt than my usual method.\", u'Between the Interior Cleaner and the micro fiber towel, it realy gets into the deep grain of the leather and pulls out the embedded dirt.', u'I was fairly astonished.', u\"I got the couch cleaner than I am usually able to - in about 1/4 of the time!Next step - apply the Griot's Leather Care, to condition and treat the leather (and clean whatever dirt still remains).\", u\"Also using the microfiber towel (either a clean towel, or clean section of same towel), applying the leather care and using a gentle but deep wiping motion - back and forth - until the 'wetness' is gone.\", u\"Then a light buff with a dry section of towel, and you're done!\", u'The leather is left with a very clean fresh look, and the surface is well mosturized but not slick or greasy.', u'Running your fingers over it gives no \"icky\" feel of excess cleaner or the greasy film that some leather conditioners leave behind.Another noteworthy comment about the Griot\\'s Leather Care is that it is (to my nose anyway) almost odorless.', u'Some leather care products have a very strong and unpleasant odor.', u\"Some are almost perfumey... but the Griot's Leather Care is a very neutral smell.\", u'I actually stuck my nose into the towel after cleaning with it, trying to get a better idea of the smell - and it was still difficult to do.All in all, this is a great kit for cleaning and conditioning leather of all types.', u'In the car, or in the house.', u'I would even be willing to try it on leather clothing, like a jacket.', u'I have not done that yet, but if I do I will update with comments.', u'I will tell you first hand that you can trust it with the \"white shades\" of leather.', u'I have various shades of \"white\" in one of my cars, and on family room furniture.', u\"Both cleaned up great with the Griot's kit with no side effects at all.\", u\"I own a large number of Griot's Garage car care products and have always been a big fan.\", u'This kit is no exception, it gets the job done, albeit at a high price.', u\"The kit includes an interior cleaner, a leather cleaner/conditioner, high quality spray bottles for both, and a set of four micro-fiber towels.PROs------------------------------------+ Kit works well, as advertised+ Griot's spray bottles are the best+ Leather conditioner leaves no residue so you can sit on it right away+ Generous-sized towelsCONs------------------------------------- Minor linting from towels (very very minor, but there is some)- To do two cars, I think you'd need 8 towels (not 4)INTERIOR CLEANER------------------------------------The Griot's Garage interior cleaner has a bubbliness to it that hints at its cleansing properties.\", u'I sprayed the cleaner directly onto the black rubber and leather surfaces of my two cars and then wiped with the towels.', u'My cars are always  fairly clean and, I think distilled water would have worked just as well.', u\"I'm pleased that the cleaner air dries and leaves no streaks, even on glossy surfaces.\", u'The end result was a spectacularly clean car interior that my wife commented on the next time she drove the car (\"wow, clean!\").', u\"This kit includes the typically excellent Griot's Garage sprayer.\", u'The pump is well built and will last a long time, even allowing for refills.LEATHER CLEANER/CONDITIONER------------------------------------------------------I later applied the leather cleaner/conditioner to the leather surfaces of two cars.', u\"Both cars have smooth black leather and in each case I couldn't tell any difference after applying.\", u'My assumption is that enough conditioner is soaking in to keep the leather fresh and supple over the long haul.', u'That is hard to judge after just one use so I\\'ll keep my eye on this over time.The leather cleaner/conditioner leaves behind no residue; this is great because it means you don\\'t have to worry about ruining your clothes after using it.TOWELS------------------------------------While the box that this comes in proudly claims \"made in America\", the four towels are clearly tagged \"made in China\".', u\"That said, my experience with Griot's Garage microfiber has always been positive and these were quite good for what essentially amounts to rags.\", u'The towels are generously sized and I used one towel per front seat for cleaning, and one towel per front seat for the leather conditioner.', u'Unfortunately, since the kit only includes 4 towels, that means I can only do one car at a time.', u\"I'd prefer to have 8 towels so I can do both of my cars.I was doing some hard scrubbing and the towels coughed up a couple of small lint balls.\", u'This was so minor that I was hesitant to mention it.', u\"But the guys that I know that buy products from Griot's Garage have high standards and they would have been angry to see green lint on their black carpet after doing the cleaning.\", u\"I'm washing the towels and will report back if the linting improves or worsens.SUMMARY------------------------------------This is another very good product from Griot's.\", u'I only gave it 4 stars because there was just enough lint from the towels that some true car care fanatics would be upset.', u'At this price, you have to be perfect to get 5 stars.', u'But this is still a really nice kit and makes a very good gift for someone that likes to take great care of their cars.', u\"If you've got leather seats in your car, you know one of two things:1) Leather seats are a bear to maintain --or--2) Leather seats deteriorate fast if you don't maintain themI've been fairly partial toMeguiar's Gold Class Rich Leather Cleaner and Conditioner, I thought I'd give this a shot, and I'm glad I did.\", u\"As a whole kit, it's a brilliant present to give someone, but even as something for yourself, the products work really well.While I can't say it restored the texture of my Charger's leather seats to like-new condition, it did a nice job working out some discolored spots, and the rest of the kit helped bring my interior back to the day I picked it up from the dealership.At this price, it's a pretty great value, especially if you visit an AutoZone or O'Reilly store and see how far this much money gets you in their car care aisles.\", u'In includes:-Micro Fiber cloth wipes-Sprayers for both bottles-Interior Cleaner-Leather Care SprayUse Interior Cleaner first to get off the heavily soiled leather.', u'The Interior cleaner contains no dyes or chemincals that will alter the surface of the original OEM finish.', u'The leather treatment contains a mild cleaner which removes contaminants while maintain a supple finish.', u'It contains vital nutrients to help leather and wipes off.', u\"It won't alter factory dyed leather.\", u'I love these Griot kits.', u'They take a few of their products, and package them together for a single purpose.', u'In this case, it is their interior cleaner, leather cleaner, and some microfiber cloths.My car has an off-white (actually ecru) leather interior.', u'I also have an eight year old daughter who rides in it and tends to get footprints in seemly impossible places.', u'Consequently, the passenger seats really needed a through cleaning.Using only the items in the kit, I first sprayed the seats down with the interior cleaner.', u'The large sprayer head made this easy.', u'Perhaps a little too easy - the seats were a bit wet!', u'I then wiped them down with one of the cloths.', u'Most of the dirt came off at that point, but there were some nooks and crannies that needed some rubbing.', u\"I also cleaned the interior door handles with the cloth, which was now wet enough that I didn't need to spray.\", u'The oil and grease came right off.Then I used the leather spray.', u\"While the interior spray really didn't smell like anything, the leather spray is scented to smell like fine leather.\", u'This was great, because after wiping down the seats my whole car smelled great!', u'The spray dried to a nice matte finish after wiping with a fresh cloth from the kit.This kit really works, and is easy and quick to use.', u'So easy, in fact, that it would make a great gift to anyone with a car that has a leather interior.', u\"Particularly if it is ecru.Highly recommended.Sean P. Logue, 2013 I have been a user of Griot's products for many years.\", u'Their Interior Cleaner I have used before and it is one of the best products of its kind I have tried.', u\"It cleans well, has no dyes or perfumes, and doesn't leave a residue behind.\", u\"It's safe on many surfaces, including leather and vinyl.The Leather Cleaner was new to me and I tried it on my car seats.\", u\"Unlike many similar products, it doesn't have a strong odor and isn't greasy.\", u\"It cleans surface dirt well and soaks into the leather quickly, not altering the color at all.Griot's offers many different varieties of their microfiber cloths, color-coded for each use.\", u'These are thick and nicely textured, good for cleaning purposes.', u'I did not find they left any lint behind.I have taken to using the Interior Cleaner in the home as well.', u'Griot products are dealer quality.', u'I always wondered how dealers were able to impart that new car feel and smell to leather upholstery.', u'Now I know.', u'This is for any car enthusiast who wants the best quality leather care.', u'I strongly recommend it.']\n"

      "[u'If you have an RV with load-range tires that require 80psi, then spend the extra coins for a compressor that is dependable in a roadside emergency.', u\"With the extension air hose there isn't any problem reaching the rear wheels on the trailer.\", u'Think about what your needs are and toss those cheaper cigarette lighter plug-in models.', u'You get what you pay for.', u'It was nice that the price was reduced 50% when I purchased this one.', u'This compressor delivers fast air at continuous operation 100% duty cycle unit is capable of pressures up to 150 PSI continuously without the need to be rested, unlike lower priced compressors that can leave you stranded.', u'I have gone through several other compressors that take long time periods to get your tires up to pressure, if the ever get there without melting down.', u'I have a F350 that we pull a 5th wheel with Class D tires inflate to 80 Lbs.', u'PSI.', u'Many of those compressors fail before achieving that pressure.', u'This is quality equipment right down to the accessories.', u'The connectors, gauges, and inflation gun are my favorites because of quality, ease of use, and accuracy.', u\"It's great for my 5th wheel and with the hose I can reach all my tires on the tow vehicle as well as the 5th wheel without  pause.\", u'I often go to my jeep or truck to use these tools instead of the many I have in my shop.', u'Two minor issues Is the rubber shocks on the sand plate I feel should be metal springs because I picture them rotting but they do work very well .', u\"Then the oddly shaped  bag is nice, but it's a bag leaving the unit somewhat vulnerable to damage,  from things being placed on top of it in loading, and difficult to pack because of its shape.\", u'I know this can happen because my first unit came freight damaged with the quick connector cracked off.', u'A hard case would be more bulky but may be a better alternative and easier to find a place to pack.', u'I have come up with my own fixes to both of those issues.', u\"These is a wise investment, and recommend it to 4X4 enthusiasts, and RV'ers.\", u'I hope to share with you my most recent experience (below) how it save me the agony of criticism from my wife and gained approval of my buying my toys.', u\"I hope the review was helpful and enjoyable.Here's the scenario.\", u'We were out camping in Mammoth lakes, CA with our 5th wheel.', u'One day while we were on a side trip leaving the 5th wheel at camp we visited some of the local natural sites.', u'This day in particular was Obsidian Dome (a huge dome of Volcanic glass).', u'After driving around it we started to explore the adjacent roads.', u'We went to several beautiful areas on good roads with no incident.', u\"The final excursion (somehow it's always the last one) we venture down a road leading across the edge of a meadow into some trees.\", u'The road started to get rougher and narrower and felt it prudent to reverse direction in a campward conclusion.', u'The road was to narrow to turn so I back down several hundred feet to a spot I could make a multiple \"Y\" turn in my 4x4 `02\\' F350 super cab that has a lousy turn radius.', u'It really becomes more of a \"W+\" maneuver.', u'I find a nice clear space and backed up into it successfully and went forward into the opposing bank in effort to re back to change my angle back down the road.', u'Now remember where I am (volcanic region with pumice for soil) and what I am driving ( a monster rv hauling truck with highway tire pressure of 80 lbs PSI).', u'That\\'s the turnaround point comes as well as the wedded bliss starts to crumble, because my front tires sink into 12\" of pumice fluff.', u\"But no problem I have a Hilift jack and the 4x4 kit (bought at Amazon .COM LLC), but I'm short on chain.\", u'So I add a old tow strap into the mix and start to pull out of the holes my tires were spinning in.', u'My wife saw the light at the end of the tunnel and the sun about ready to go behind the mountain.', u'She actually said she would never complain about \"My toys I buy\".', u\"That lasted for about 5 minutes when the old strap stitching at the hook gave away and the truck rolled back into it's original position.\", u\"From experience I swiftly said That's OK I can still fix this.\", u'I said We need to rethink this.', u'She started mumbling something like she would go to the Bahamas next year.', u\"I couldn't help thinking my tire pressure was an issue here so I break out the Viair compressor (bought at Amazon .COM LLC),.\", u'She said whats that?, another toy?', u'I installed the tire valve stem deflators (bought at Amazon .COM LLC),  and took the pressure to 15 lbs.', u'This is a piece of advice: get her busy picking up bark and stuff to add body to the pumice or sand.', u'Eureka!', u'SCORE!', u'The trick did the job and I kept my smartest man in the world status with my lovely red head (the dogs never lost the faith).', u'We got turned around without calling AAA before dark and proceeded down the road to a junction with very good base.', u'Now this is where the compressor comes in.', u'Now I need to reflate the tires to Highway pressure.', u'My experience with other compressors was they will take an immense time to refill and melt down after lengthily operation.', u'This compressor promises contrary to that and delivers.', u'In fact It seemed to fill just as fast as my 3 hp compressor in my shop.', u'On the same road trip my air lift bag compressor melted down and I was able to manually use this one to fill my bags.', u'Turns out my wife approved the purchases and we will be returning to Mammoth next year.', u'&#61514; What can I say, this machine is fantastic.', u'With a 100% duty cycle and check all my tires and fill as needed and not have to wait for it to cool down.', u'I went and added 5 to 8 lbs to all 4 tires on one car and 2 more on the other.', u'The motor never even got warm.', u'The cary bag is great and has lots of room for other small items.', u'The aire nozle locks onto the valve stem and the gage is failry accurate.', u'Everything is heavy duty construction.', u'Should have bought one years ago.', u'Now it is not as fast as the air pump at the gas stationor the big compresor in my gerage but for a small hand held unit it is fast enogh.', u'Besides, when I am out in the boonies what is a few minutes to air up over no air at all.', u\"It's nice to have the security of extra air in case of a flat tire.\", u'I bought this for a 9000 mile roadtrip this summer with some friends, not one problem on the trip.', u'However, the day after returning home I walked out to a flat tire.', u'I plugged in the compressor and in minutes my 35\" tire was full of air and I could drive to the shop to get it repaired.', u'No waiting for a towtruck to come help out.', u'Nice.', u'Solidly built, sturdy little compressor.', u'I look forward to many years of travel with this little gadget.', u'Fabulous unit, compact, quiet, powerful, and not too heavy.', u'I cut off the alligator clamps and wired it to a 7-way trailer connector so that I can plug it in to the rear of my truck.', u'12v is only present when the truck is running so this is a foolproof setup.', u'I like the 100% duty cycle although I do not expect that to be an issue.', u'I purchased this for use after driving on the beach, allowing me to refill my 32&#34; tires after airing down for sand work.', u'This thing is QUIET!', u'You can hold a comfortable conversation while this thing is running.', u'Comes with a very generous carrying case, and everything you need to use out of the box, with extra air filters included.', u\"I haven't had a chance to try it with any air tools or lockers, but if you need a quick, quality and quiet compressor to fill up your tires after the trail don't hesitate!\", u'This is also best price I could find.', u'I have a 1993 M35A3 with 6 Michelin 14.5 XLs and a spare.', u'The CTIS (central tire inflation system) had been disconnected, and the split wheel o-rings need to be replaced.', u'This means that I have 7 huge tires with slow leaks.', u'I have the truck in an apartment complex parking lot with no electricity for my big Makita 5hp compressor.', u'And my honda generator cant crank over the Makita.', u'I had a little red compressor from VIAR, which was good in the emergency I needed it for, but got so hot in inflating these tires that it melted the yellow hose.The 450P was hooked up to my yellow goodyear hose and Subaru Outback (running), and put to work right out of the box.', u'It took 5 of these tires from 15 lbs or less to 45 lbs in about 35 minutes.', u\"When you have 13,000 lbs of truck, having tires that roll is critical, because even a wrecker can't move them with deflated tires.\", u'The pump was hot, but the inflating pipe on the compressor runs through the padded handle, which allows you to pick it up when hot.', u'The gauge has a trigger and a  lever that holds fitting on to the tire valve, which is really handy.', u'Having a switch vs using the battery clamps to start saves on sparking.I was at a loss as to how I was going to get these tires inflated in remote situations with out a huge generator to run a huge compressor...so this continuous duty 12v pump was very timely.', u\"(for those of you who are military truck experts, I am aware the M35A3 has an on board compressor, but there is a blockage somewhere ahead of the 'glad hands.')\", u'The M35A3 is about the largest truck (23,000 lbs gvw) you can drive in NC without a license , and has 7 really big tires to say grace over.', u'This is not a replacement for a functioning CTIS or a big compressor, but will get even the largest tires inflated and rolling.']\n"

improvement.Otherwise the fit was good, easy installation, and they lasted more than a day (unlike the Anco's I bought when I had no other choice).\", u'Like the idea of the wear indicator as well, but not sure how accurate it is.', u'The ACDelco 26\" Clear Vision Wiper blade fits the driver\\'s side and the 21\" the passenger\\'s side of my 2004 Dodge Durango 4X4.', u'The wipers themselves perform great!', u'They \"hug\" the windshield, leaving a streak-free clear field of vision.', u'What worries me is the flimsy hardware.', u'The clip/bracket is only held together with a small piece of cheap plastic that can easily come off.', u'With the harsh winters we have here in Western New York, I worry these wipers will easily break off when frozen to my windshield.It will be interesting to see how the wear indicator works out since it is suppose to take out the guess work of when to change your wipers.', u'I was always going by the the numbers of streaks left behind to let me know it was time for new wipers.UPDATE 01/22/2013It happen...we have about 4 feet of snow fall and the temperatures fall down to 10 degrees Fahrenheit.', u'I went to lift the wipers off the windshield and I saw one of the black plastic brackets fly up in the air and was left with the wiper on my hand.', u'Luckily I was able to fins the bracket to attach the wiper back on till I could get back home to change them to a winter wiper.I believe these are probably a great Spring or Summer wiper but not made to tackle a harsh winter.', u'Wiper came loose and allow arm to scratch wind shield.', u'I even check several times to made sure wipers are attached securely.', u'Lousy design.', u'These are generally OK blades in that they do what they are supposed to do - clear the windshield.', u\"However, I found them to be a clear notch below the Bosch ICON in terms of both performance and build quality.On the plus side, the ACDelco's come with a wide variety of attachment accessories.\", u\"I can't imagine there is a wiper arm that these won't fit on using one of the supplied connection adapters.The overall heft of the blade, however, is definitely lower than that of the ICON.\", u'The ACDelco\\'s are lighter weight and just don\\'t feel as \"solid\" as the Bosch.That translates to performance.', u'I put the ACDelco on the passenger side, and kept the ICON (about 1 month old) on the drivers side.', u'The Bosch cleaned very well - no streaks or misses.', u'The ACDelco left some water in streaks on the upstroke, but got them on the downstroke.', u'The Bosch were almost silent; the ACDelco made some noise - not what I\\'d call loud, but certainly louder in operation than the Bosch.The unique feature of the AC Delco is that it has a \"wear strip\" that turns color when (supposedly) it\\'s time to change the blade.', u\"I don't see much value in that.\", u'I change wiper blades when one (or both) of the following occur:1.', u'It makes more noise than I can live with2.', u\"It does not clean the windshield to my satisfaction.I really don't need a color change to help me make that decision.While the Bosch cost more, for me they are worth it.\", u'The AC Delco are less expensive but less effective.', u\"If you're not fussy about wiper blades these are worth a shot; if not go for the ICONs.\", u'I am a big fan of these single beam wiper blades, and this blade works well.', u'The blade contours well to the windshield, no missed spots, no chatter.The wear indicator seems to be a small colored dot that changes color over time, not really a \"wear\" indicator, but an indicator for the lengths of time the wiper is exposed to the elements.', u'Perhaps this blade lasts so long they want to remind you to buy another set?The downside of this particular blade is the adapter.', u'It is big, bulky, and overly complex.', u'I am glad they post the video online because the instructions may not be clear.The install of the proper clip is fairly easy, but there are too many parts in the box, no indication as to what needs to be used together, and it is difficult to identify the proper orientation for the clip to be installed.I use what I thought was the most popular u curve slide in clip.', u'The adapter for that type on this blade is very large.', u'Most wipers I have used have a very low profile for this type, the u curve slides easily into the main connector.', u'But on this blade you have to add a bulky tower connector and the u curve attaches there.If you have a blade that slides down into a hidden area, I wonder if there might be some clearance issues.', u\"My car doesn't have that so I stare at that big black box right in front of me all the time.\", u'I put a set of these blades on my truck 2 months ago.', u'according to the package it\\'s hot selling point is the \"wear indicator\" where the black dot will change to yellow to let you know when you should change the blade.Well, admittedly I am no where near the yellow dot, in fact my dot is still very much black.', u'HOWEVER I have hit another snag with these wiper blades and that is that the blades provide multiple hinge attachments so that the blade can be used with any wiper arms.', u'Here is the problem The top lock pinch tab that is separate and needs to be attached to the blade and then you choose the adaptor needed to convert the blade to your vehicle ie.side lock, hook lock, pin side, etc.', u\"It is a classic engineering quandary, theory vs. practice: What looks great on paper doesn't quite make it in the real world.I live in Wyoming.\", u'It is cold and dry and sometimes wet & frozen, we have temperature fluctuations.', u\"Twice since I've snapped all the components together I've had to re-attach them because the cold warps the plastic and causes them to pop apart.\", u'I have actually been able to overcome this problem with trusty duct tape.', u'And with the tape making sure everything holds together these are pretty good blades.', u\"But I don't think a person should have to pay 17-plus-bucks for something that will require duct tape to secure success.\", u\"I removed the driver's side wiper blade from my pick-up.\", u'I was unable to install the ACDelco with any of the adapters that were furnished.', u'I went to the Amazon web site and entered the information for my vehicle and the response was that this wiper blade was a match for my vehicle.', u\"So, it must be just me that can't get it installed and I need to try a different approach.I took my Frontier back to the Nissan dealer where I purchased the vehicle.\", u'I asked the dealer to install the wiper blade and while there go ahead and change the oil and rotate the tires.', u'The dealer did the oil and tire thing as usual but was unable to get the ACDelco blade to work.', u'I asked him to put my original blade back on, which he did, and I recycled the ACDelco.Against the advice I did look this gift horse in the mouth and it had no teeth.', u'AC Delco Clear Vision 24 Inch Wiper BladesThese blades are similar to the Bosch, Rain-X, Michelin, and Pylon single-piece frameless blades that are sold in retail stores.', u'They are approximately 3-4 times the cost of a traditional framed wiper blade.', u\"I've used the Michelin, Rain-X, Pylon, and Bosch Clear Advantage single-piece frameless blades in the past, and have found that the rubber blade generally lasts 1-3 years before they start to deteriorate.\", u\"By deteriorate, I mean the rubber starts to set into a shape and no longer clears the glass as well as I'd like, which can result in streaking that can't be fixed by cleaning the blade using alcohol or other cleaners.\", u\"The single-piece blades cost more and don't deliver any significant benefits to justify the added cost, but they look cool and all the foreign luxury cars come with them from the factory as of 4-6 years ago.The AC Delco Clear Vision blades come with a multitude of adapters, unlike the blades that are generally sold in most retail stores like Meijer, Target, or Wal-Mart (those are generally designed for the J-Hook style of arms which is common).\", u'However, many late model GM cars use a different attachment which requires an adapter that happens to be included in the AC Delco Clear Vision package.The AC Delco blades use adapters that are easy to clip into the body of the blade.', u'I chose to use the J-hook adapters because my car uses those type of wiper arms.', u'Installation was literally a snap.', u\"I immediately noticed that the blades were clearing my windshield without any streaks compared to my 3 year old Rain-X frameless blades.The spring that is used to provide the pressure for the blade to press against the windshield appears to be very strong, but this isn't much different from any other new wiper blade.\", u'These AC Delco blades have a \"wear indicator\" strip that is covered by tape to be removed after installation.', u'I did an Internet search on these indicators, and it appears Valeo uses them on their VW branded blades, and is nothing more than a strip that changes color with exposure to UV radiation.', u'This makes sense, since UV radiation contributes significantly to rubber deterioration.', u'However, time will tell on when this indicator recommends replacing the blade.', u'Even when I park my car outside year-round in Michigan, I can easily get 3 years out of a set of wiper blades: framed or frame less and regardless of brand.', u'And even then, I could get by with using ratty old wiper blades.', u\"There's nothing that suggest the blades will fall apart and be unsafe to use within a year, especially when frameless blades cost so much these days.In conclusion, are these AC Delco Clear Vision blades worth every penny?\", u'I have yet to be convinced that frameless blades are superior to framed blades.', u'Sure, there are less joints and moving pieces, but at a price point that is 3-4 times that of the least expensive Pylon/Trico framed blades?', u\"I can't say these or any other frameless blades are mandatory especially when they last just as long as the cheap framed blades before streaking.\", u'To be safe, replace your wiper blades each year but my experience shows they can last 2-3 years easily as long as nothing physically breaks.Overall: 4/5 stars, great frameless construction, comes with a multitude of adapters that clip into the body, strong spring to provide coverage on windshield.', u\"Still doesn't fully conform to my curved windshield at the edges, and these still don't convince me they will outlast an inexpensive framed blade.I will keep this review updated as I continue to use these wiper blades.UPDATE: 14 JAN 2013I've been able to use these blades in a variety of conditions, and this morning was the first time I had the opportunity to use this in freezing precipitation (ice and melting ice).\", u'The blades started to take a \"set\" in shape instead of trying to hug the glass, probably because of ice on the blade material.', u'They began chattering and streaking and I noticed the driver side was skipping over a spot on the glass, but the interesting part is that the wiper arm connects to the blade right at this spot so there is definitely enough pressure.', u'So all in all, these blades performed on-par or worse than the 3-year old Michelin Radius blades that these replaced.', u\"The wiper comes with several adapters, and you have to choose the one that's right for your car.\", u\"Unfortunately for me, the one that's right for my car is HUGE... and very distracting.I noticed it right away, as soon as I sat in the driver's seat.\", u'It actually impinged on my vision just a little on the bottom of the windshield-- it had a higher profile than my other wiper (which I left on the passenger side for comparison purposes), and it was just distracting because of its bulbous shape.', u\"When I turned on the wipers, I actually felt like it was dangerous, because it was such a focal point that my eyes kept going to the adapter while I was driving in the rain... every time the wiper went by, I couldn't help but notice it again.\", u\"Like a giant black bug or something-- you just can't NOT notice it.\", u\"I hoped it would get more invisible to me as I got used to it and continued driving (it was a long drive home), but that didn't happen.It makes very good contact with the windshield and worked well, with no missed spots on the windshield.\", u\"I'm guessing that if you needed any other adapter than the one I needed, you'd probably be fine-- but the one I needed just made it too much of an eyesore.I had already thrown out the old wiper, so I'm out of luck and need to buy another one now.\", u'These wiper blades work fine.', u\"That said, so do all other new wiper blades I've ever purchased.\", u\"They don't feel like they're built of adamantium, or made of magical unicorn rubber, so I don't see why they're so expensive.\", u'The adapters they come with work fine, but they do stick out in a rather bulky way, as has been pointed out in other reviews.', u\"I'm sure that's dropped my gas mileage a non-noticeable amount.\", u'They do come with a magical color-changing \"time to replace\" indicator, but it\\'s usually not hard to figure out when wiper blades need replacing: they stop working well.Anyway, they\\'re fine, but for the money, I\\'d just stick with the ANCO cheapies.', u'All blades work great when new, but need to be replaced regularly.', u\"I haven't yet seen a pair that are worth three times the cost of the generics.\", u'The wiper blades work well so far (of course, they always do when they\\'re new) and make good contact with the glass along the whole length of the blade, although  I think the \"1,500 pressure points\" is just marketing hyperbole.', u\"I like the versatility of working with different styles of wipers but installation wasn't entirely simple.\", u'I have the hook style wipers and the diagrams inside were tiny and not very clear.', u'You have to snap on a different adapter depending on the style and it makes for a rather large knob at the connection point - bigger even than theBoschblades (although the blades themselves are thinner).', u'Even then it popped off easily when I bumped it while scraping frost from the windows - never had that happen with other blades.', u\"And frankly, they're just kinda ugly and look big and clumsy.\", u'I\\'m also not too keen on the \"wear indicator\" as it seems \"gimicky\" and I have no idea how it works.', u\"It seems I ought to be able to see when the performance deteriorates but this way it'll probably just have a big yellow dot in front of me whether I want to replace them or not (we don't get a lot of rain here in SoCal).\", u'TheACDelco 26ACD Clear Vision Wiper Blade with Wear Indicator - 26\" (Pack of 1)was not difficult to install because I am familiar with blade installation.', u'If you need instructions, this is not best wiper blade.', u'Arriving with several adaptors, none were needed, but were stored until this blade is replaced later this year.', u\"As for the wear indicator, I cannot comment because it's a new blade and from what I understand, a new product to ACDelco.\", u\"It does clear the windshield as required, but isn't the most sleek in style.\", u\"It's price point is higher than many and I suspect that's because of the wear indicator.\", u'Since I change blades a maximum of annually, this is wasted on the car which wears the wiper.', u'Should you need a reminder, assuming that this really does give a visual clue, perhaps this is a great blade for your car.', u\"For the price, it's not a bad blade, just not an outstanding blade.\", u'I have been using this 22\" ACDelco Clear Vision Wiper Blade for several weeks on the driver\\'s side of my 2007 Hyundai Accent GS.', u\"I have to say I'm not really impressed.Fit and mounting are okay though the so-called instructions printed on the back of the label insert are almost impossibly to see and are somewhat vague.\", u'The J-Mount connector that my car requires sits rather high on the wiper arm.', u'MUCH higher than the Bosch 22\" Clear Advantage wiper blade I had been using.', u\"It's mildly distracting and somewhat unattractive.The important part - Function.\", u'In mild to moderate rain the Clear Vision wiper blade does a good job of clearing the windshield.', u'It seemed to struggle a little during a brief heavy downpour.', u'But the worst part is how these work in light mist and fog.', u'The wiper blade leaves what can only be described as a film on the windshield.', u\"It's not highly visible all the time but catch the sunlight at the right angle and it becomes rather difficult to see out the windshield.\", u\"I've tried cleaning the blade twice with isopropyl alcohol and a microfiber cloth but it still films/streaks the entire windshield in mist and fog.\", u\"Heavy use of washer fluid will clear the streaking/filming but that's just wasting washer fluid.I'll probably leave these on the car for now since it's the dry season but once it starts raining every day when summer gets here I'm going back to the Bosch blade.I really can't recommend these wiper blades.\", u'These wipers require replacing the entire wiper component, not just the plastic part.', u\"So the first difficulty I ran into was figuring out how to get the original ones off, as this isn't even in my car manual.\", u'Had to google it to find out how to do it.', u'Then to put the blades on, you have to figure out which adapter to use and how to snap it into place.', u\"The directions for this are ridiculously small and impossible to decipher, so it's pretty much a trial and error thing.\", u'Once I got it snapped on, I was able to put the blade on, and it seemed to work reasonably well enough for a couple weeks.', u'That was, until I was driving in a slight drizzle, turned on my wipers, and I guess the window had some dry spots that caused the blade to stick a little bit and the connector just snapped off, sending the entire blade flying through the air.', u\"Thankfully it didn't hit anyone, or another car, or I could have had some real damages to pay.\", u'Luckily I saved the original wipers which went back on the car ASAP.', u'These went into the garbage.', u'I will note that my wipers use the J-style connector, and another reviewer mentioned a similar issue with their car and the same style connector, so it may be a particular issue with this one.', u\"However, I am just not sure I would trust these wipers and these connectors that aren't permanently attached to the wiper and prone to just snapping apart.\", u'These ACDelco wiper blades ship with multiple adapters so they will fit a variety of vehicles.', u'The installation directions cryptic and virtually useless.', u\"I wish I'd noticed the videos provided on the product page before I did my install.The adapters are bulky in size and are noticeably distracting in your field of vision when you're driving.\", u\"Furthermore, both the adapters and the blades are made of plastic similar to what you'd expect from a Chinese made dollar store toy.\", u'The blades feel super flimsy and do not even have the strength to hold the wiper against the curve of the windshield from end to end.', u'The actual rubber wiper does a decent job, where it touches the glass.These blades come equipped with a wear indicator that is supposed to let you know when it is time to replace the blade.', u'I do not have any expectation that the blade will actually last long enough for that indicator to be needed.', u\"*This review applies to both of the two different lengths of blades I tested* I got one of these for my wife's Taurus, which has a pretty rounded back window that causes some 'missed' spots at the ends of the blades of standard flat wiper blades.\", u'These wiper blades are naturally rounded and contact the glass along the entire edge.', u\"I was able to use one size larger, increasing visibility while still making full contact with the glass.The one thing I really don't like is the connection when the the wiper blade is mounted to the wiper arm on the car.\", u'The package includes a whole range of options to choose from, covering nearly any make or model car, but the connection point is WAY too big.', u'Normally, the arm of the wiper fits inside of the wiper blade frame, providing a thin profile.', u'These blades have plastic clips that attach to the wiper arm, and then attach to a base on the wiper blade itself.', u'This makes the connection point for a wiper arm to the blade twice as thick as my old wiper blade (1\" compared to 1/2\").', u\"Along the entire length of the blade, the profile is kept very simple and thin, but once you get to the wiper arm connection, it's much taller then the rest of the blade.\", u'Despite the fact that the AC Delco blade is only a little bit taller then my old blade, the design makes it look a LOT taller.', u\"After replacing the rear wiper on my wife's car (without her knowledge), she walked by and the wiper blade 'knuckle' immediately caught her attention and she questioned me about it.\", u\"She was surprised to find that it wasn't too much taller then her last blade as she too was fooled by the odd profile of the wiper blade.I ended up buying a different brand of blades for my wife's front wipers (Trico).\", u\"These were much slimmer and shorter, and seemed easier to install, but they didn't include nearly as many connector pieces, so likely wouldn't be as universal as these blades.\", u\"If they made these connectors so large in order to accommodate a larger variety of vehicles, I'd simply say that it wasn't worth it.Overall, I like the fact that the wiper blade does a good job contacting the glass, and the blade works well and is streak-free, however the size of the connecting piece is, in my opinion, unnecessarily large.\", u\"If you have a vehicle that you normally have trouble finding a wiper blade to fit, I'd recommend giving these a shot.\", u\"Otherwise, I'd have to give these blades a few months to determine if the longevity makes it all worth it because I personally just don't like the appearance.\"]\n"

      "[u\"I use a lot of Griot's garage products and like them.\", u\"So when I found myself running low on Meguiar's Gold Class Car Wash I decided to buy this Griots's Garage Car Wash.\", u\"I am attaching a photo of the bottle I received in this order next to the ruler - the 16 oz bottle is 6 inches tall.Griot's Garage Car Wash generated good suds and worked well.\", u\"However, it did not work any better than Meguiar's Gold Class Car Wash or several other car wash concentrates I used in the past.\", u\"I did not spend any less time on washing, I still needed to clayGriot's Garage Cleaning Claymy car to remove small imperfections.\", u\"The main difference which may matter to someone that Griot's Garage is totally orderless, where as other car washes I used have a scent.On the negative side Griot's Garage Car Wash is rather pricey.\", u'At the price of $8.99 this works out to 56 cents per oz.', u\"Meguiar's Gold Class Car Wash that I bought at a local retailer was $4.43 for 72 oz., 10 cents per oz.\", u\"Overall, I satisfied my curiosity and will not be buying it again.Ali Julia review Big fan of Griot's products and the car wash is not exception.\", u\"Works well with the other Griot's products.\", u\"Doesn't strip wax and builds a nice bucket of suds to help pull dirt away from you paint while you wash.\", u'I buy it by the gallon.', u\"I have four vehicles to wash and Griot's is used on all of them.\", u\"All of Griot's products have a great fragrance.\", u'Very pleasant to the nose and my wife will come outside and comment on the pleasant smell.', u'Great product.', u\"I've used this product since 2003.\", u\"It's a premium car wash but I think it is overpriced considering you can get a lot more for a lot less with some other brands.The suds that this car wash produces are really good.\", u'The product is very slippery, it smells great, and I think the cleaning power is very effective.', u'You can even use it full strength to remove stubborn dirt.', u'I like the fact that it is a little thicker than most car washes and I think this is why it produces such rich suds.', u\"This car wash is tough on dirt but it won't strip wax.16 oz for eight bucks is a little too much for a car wash considering you can get 64 oz from Mothers for a few more bucks.\", u\"I also think that the Mothers is the better product simply because it does everything this product does for less money.I personally switched over to Mothers California Gold and I haven't looked back.\", u'It does everything a car wash should do and at a great price.', u\"These day's you have so many different car washes on the market and most of them are pretty good.\", u'Meguiars Gold Class is also an excellent choice.', u\"I really don't think one car wash can perform any better than another as far as cleaning goes; they will all get your car clean.\", u\"The only differences would be suds, smell, if it is gentle on existing wax, and of course price.If price is not a concern and you insist on the Griot's Car Wash, then this is a great product.\", u\"I love this car wax, it really dosen't leave spots!\", u'Unavailable locally.', u\"Groit's seems to have good, quality products no matter which on you buy and use.\", u'Excellent offering Amazon...', u\"I've tried all brands and my search has stopped for a great car wash liquid.\", u\"It has a cherry sent which is different then any other brand I've ever used, so it was kind of weird.\", u\"That aside, it just sudz'ed up really nicely.\", u'The foam lasted the entire time while washing the car.', u\"Since it's a strong concentrate, you don't need much per car.The bottle itself is well thought out as well.\", u\"In lieu of removing the cap and pouring out the product you just pop the top that doesn't come off and just squeeze out what you need.\", u'No cap to lose.', u'There is also an indicator that tells you approx how many cars it will do.Great product and you can buy one gallon refills.', u'This car wash is definitely worth the price.Streak free shine, pleasant smell and a little goes a long way.Cleans very well.', u\"The car wash smells like cherry's and is high quality for the cheap price.\", u\"Griot's Garage products are really good products and recommend for a detailer and enthusiasts.\", u'I have used many different brands of car wash soap, and this is among my favorites.', u\"I still like the Meguire's products a lot and use them too.\", u\"But Griot's Car Wash is well engineered for washing cars.\", u'It is highly concentrated, so a little bit goes a long way.', u'A gallon of this stuff should last you all year.', u'It is also very very slick and slippery - which is good!!', u\"I don't want to scratch my car while I'm washing it carefully by hand (that would defeat the purpose).\", u\"This formula provides great lubrication to glide the dirt and grime away without scratching.I also use this for my wheels and tires, though sometimes a stronger detergent is needed there, depending on the level of grime and brake dust.Griot's also sells a pump dispenser for their gallon containers that I find very useful for the car wash.\", u'It pumps it easily into a smaller bottle for daily use, with no mess and no waste.', u'I recommend looking for that.Overall, this is an excellent car wash soap - from a company solely dedicated to the care of your baby.', u\"I trust Griot's products to keep my cars top notch, and use them all the time!\", u\"I'm a big big fan of all these products if you love your car and you want something non harsh to use on new paint or older cars this car wash stuff is what you need it soaps well and  along with the other products will give your car a high gloss and shine.\"]\n"

at 12x16, they\\'re somewhat larger than the other brands I use.', u'I find myself usually folding these sorts of towels into small squares, and the extra size gives me more working time with a single towel...definitely a plus.', u'They are also very soft and absorbent, but still seem able to hold up to hard use.About the only gripe is that they tend to shed a bit when brand new out of the box.', u'I used one to clean my windshield, and I could see a series of fine threads afterwards left on my window.', u'Wash a few times and this is gone - but other brands seem a bit better out of the box.', u'Still, the size, thickness and softness make up for it, and at the price, these are definitely worth checking out.', u'I would put these on-par with Z-wipes and notch or two above the bulk variety you can find at your local Costco.', u\"They did shed significantly less than the Costco variety upon initial use and after using all of the above, I would say that they do pick up dust and cat-fur better than the Z-wipes, and significantly better than the Costco version.If I had to choose between these and the Zwipes, I'd go with the Zwipes variety pack as they have some purpose built microfibers that work exceptionally well on glass, drying, etc.\", u'For general purpose cleanup and/or dusting around the house, these are superior.', u\"These towels seem well-made and have been really useful the few times I've used them.\", u\"I expect to use them again with some Meguiar's products to buff up my Hyundai Equus.\", u\"Not usre if that is the best use of these towels but I'll edit this review if I find out anything useful in that regard.\", u'These towels do an amazing job when it comes to cleaning a car.I would recommend these towels.The more plush microfiber towels seem easier to clean with and absorb more dirt,water, and so forth.I also prefer the black towels.Good deal for the money.5-Pack Of Microfiber Towels-Two Black 16\" by 16\" All Purpose Micro fiber Cleaning Towels - Two - 16\" by 16\"White All Purpose Microfiber Cloths - One 16\\' By 18\" Microfiber Glass Cleaning Towel Wonderful towels.', u'They seem to be very well made, decent thickness and a great size.Endlessly useful for everything under the roof.', u\"I've never understood why so many microfiber towels are primarily pastel colors.I'm glad to find some that are a decent, useful size and available in darker colors.\", u'I regularly use microfiber towels, generally for cleaning tasks anywhere (household, outdoor, garage, automotive, etc).', u'Although these are listed in the automotive section, I really like them for use all around the house.', u'The grey color is great and can be hard to find.', u'The color did not fade (I washed the towels separately in hot water before first use just in case) and does not show dirt like other colors.', u'The towels washed up nicely, were fluffy and did not curl up on the edges.', u'I like the handy rectangular shape (12\"x16\") versus the typical square.', u'The most important part - they performed well for both dry (dusting) and wet (cleaning and drying) tasks.', u\"I love the size, it's larger than most that you get in a pack.\", u\"My husband likes darker colors because they don't show the soil so fast.\", u\"Washing is a breeze and it doesn't lose the cushy softness and special feel microfiber has.\", u'These were very good towels, great for waxing and polishing the car.I thought they were a little too nice to use with on nasty household/garage jobs, but great for jobs where you need a soft clean cloth to work with.Between these and the ZwipesZwipes Microfiber Cleaning Cloths (36-Pack)I thought the Z-Wipes were softer and had more depth.', u\"That was better for car work (Polishing, Waxing), but the Heininger GarageMates did much better for polishing metal, cleaning glass, and interior work like plastics and leather.There's virtually no fuzz on these, which makes them great for things like glass and mirrors which I've had a heck of a time doing with anything but newspaper.\", u\"Use them withRain-X 800002243 Glass Treatmentand expend much less energy and still don't get those hazy streaks.They clean up in the wash better than the zwipes, probably in part since they're dark colored and don't show the dirt as bad.Definitely a heck of a value.\", u'If you do your own car cleaning and detailing, you know you will go through a lot of microfiber towels (tip #1- normal used cotton towels are too scratchy, especially for interior work).', u'These are also a must for any cleaning work on LCD screens (like your TV, Computer Monitor and Navigation screen in many cars).', u'And you can never have too many, especially once your significant other finds out about how soft they are.', u\"So no worries, just throw another stack of 10 into your next Amazon order and you're good to go.\", u'Tip #2, once these are dirty keep them separate from your other laundry and only wash them with other microfiber towels.', u\"Tip #3, I keep a fresh one in my car's driver door storage bin at all times, as they do a great job of cleaning the haze off of the interior glass between detailing sessions.\", u'Plus if you have a coffee accident, the towel is right there to bail you out.So good quality microfiber towels in a ten pack, at a low Amazon price- recommended.', u\"I'm pretty anal about cleaning my cars.\", u'I own a Ferrari, a high end Porsche as well as a classic restored MG TD.', u\"I'm careful about what types of towels touch their paint.\", u\"These microfiber towels from Heininger are at least as good as the microfiber towels I used to purchase from classic car specialty shops.These towels are not used to wash the car nor dry it when it's soaking wet; they aren't the right size nor material, but they are perfect for drying and buffing small areas after the application of detailing sprays such as Griot's SpeedShineGriot's Garage 11146 Speed Shine - 35 oz..\", u'They are also great for cleaning the inside of the car -- great for dusting.', u'I keep one in each glove compartment.While they can be washed, I sometimes simply throw them away if they get too dirty.', u\"If you wash them, don't use a fabric softener.\", u'Fabric softeners interfere with the functionality of the microfibers.', u'Ideal for dusting and cleaning your house and car.', u'These are quality towels, although I own some that are slightly heavier, but these work and hold up very well.', u'I would definitely buy these same towels in the future.', u\"I'm no textile expert, but color aside, these seem identical toZwipes, which I consider one of the best purchases I ever made.GarageMate microfiber towels can be used dry or wet.\", u'They are great for picking up dust, or spills, so keep a couple handy inside your vehicle.', u'Used wet, you really only need water, except for dirt that requires solvent (tar, bug splatter).', u'You can add a drop of dishwashing liquid to a bucket if the dirt is crusty.', u'Wipe on, then wipe off with a dry towel.', u'You can use them inside the house, too.', u'Great for cleaning glass and mirrors.These are sturdy, absorbent, machine-washable, and dry quickly.', u'Do not use fabric softener or dryer sheets.', u'I often machine wash and hang them to dry.So, look, guys.', u\"You know that skanky bunch of old t-shirts and sweat socks you've been hoarding for car washing?\", u'Get rid of them and get these.', u'They work ten times better!', u\"And they don't get musty.\", u\"And remember, a girl likes a clean car, but she doesn't have to know how little effort you put into it.\", u'I use these to wax my bike and car.', u\"They are much more thick than most of my other microfiber towels, and they're completely lint-free.\", u\"They're also much more nappy than most of the other towels I've come across.\", u\"With 10, you can also dedicate 1-2 for 'household cleaning' without worrying about it.\", u'Highly recommended, really high quality.I received this from the manufacturer for testing and review and have shared my honest experience in this review.', u'The product description omits my favorite use of these towels... polishing the finish on my automobiles.', u'The product description says the towels do not require you to use chemicals.', u'While that is true, it is not a unique feature of these towels.', u'It could apply to any towel.Best use: polishing.Non-recommended uses.', u'Greasy tools, window glass.', u'For these, you want an abrasive cloth.These are definately non abrasive.', u'These are well finished towels and not particularly thick.', u'They are split microfiber, so they do absorb a bit and work well for cleaning.', u'The black color does not come off when wet, so it seems they have done a nice job with the dye.My only complaint about these is that they are not super soft.', u'They are not rough, but I have used other softer microfiber towels from my local auto shop.', u'Maybe these are just thinner, but the impression I have is that they are not as soft as some of the others.', u\"In any event, it's not like these are going to scratch up your car or come anywhere near being called abrasive.one star deduction because not quite as soft and think as some others I have run across.\", u\"I've used a wide variety of microfiber shop towels, and the Heininger 5410 towels are pretty good for a towel meant for general use.\", u'The size is good for most uses and the towel is soft enough to not worry about scratching and strong enough not to worry about falling apart.', u'Absorbency is typical, which is to say not as much as a cotton towel, but useful enough.', u\"Perhaps the most striking feature of these towels is the brilliant red color - the photo doesn't do it justice!\", u\"I've been detailing my own vehicles for the past 15 years and have become rather particular about what makes contact with the paint.\", u'Use the wrong type of towel and you can end up with swirl marks or worse, scratches on the paint.', u\"Things you may not notice until the wax starts to wear off.First it's important to note that these aren't meant to be used with soap and water or to dry off a soaking wet vehicle.\", u\"They aren't large enough and really aren't the best material.\", u\"For that, you'd want a good wash mitt and 100% cotton towel.\", u\"But if you're looking to do some waxing, dusting, or touch-up with a detailing spray, these are perfect.I've already used them for my regular detailing on my black GMC Sierra Denali and they worked exactly as I expected them to.\", u\"Yes, it's a fun color to keep clean!\", u\"I dusted with my duster, applied the detailing spray, wiped it off with the microfiber towel, and then followed up with another unused towel to make sure I didn't miss anything.That second pass with a dry towel is important.\", u\"That's how you make sure you don't end up with smear marks.\", u'Then dusted the interior, also using the microfiber towel, with the GM detailing spray which takes care of all of the leather and plastics.', u\"Finish up by wiping down the chrome wheels and I've got a shiny truck.So they passed the initial test and worked great.\", u'Only time will tell after multiple uses and washes if they hold up.', u\"I'll post a follow up review once I've gotten some more use out of them.\", u'For now, I consider them recommended.']\n"

light, which would indicate to you if you have a short in your car (or I suppose internal to the battery), so you can be forewarned.', u'I have not had to use that indicator, and hopefully it will not light up...The other interesting feature of this charger is that it provides a &#34;rest&#34; period on the battery every so often to see if it behaves abnormally.', u'If there is a short or the battery is starting to go bad, this test stage may be an indicator before you get a hard failure of the battery.For the most part, Id compare this unit to the far cheaper ($50ish) Battery Tender, made by a competing company.', u'I have both.', u'I like both.', u'I prefer the increased indication that is provided by the status lights on this one, and also like the fact that this one uses a multi-frequency desulfation process, which though I have not had to prove to work or not work, does in theory help reduce the formation and presence of sulfate crystals.', u'This unit can also run its temperature compensation to a remote location, which is good if the vehicle you are maintaining is outside of a garage.I do wish this product were around $30 cheaper to be competitive with the  battery tender which is also temperature-compensated.', u'This one is differentiated by its desulfation capability, but the much higher price causes it to be docked one star.', u'I studied the specifications of many battery chargers and reviewed their customer feedback on amazon.com before I chose the BatteryMINDer 2012 charger.Positives :- Temperature compensated charging to prevent over- and undercharging by using a temperature sensor- Shows actual state of charging (soft start, constant current, constant voltage, float)- High frequency charging pulses (instead of regular current charging) to reduce battery sulphation- Can be connected to any AC power source between 110 and 240 V- Long charging cables to locate battery charger away from batteryThe BatteryMINDer 2012 has lights to indicate a weak battery or bad cell which are activated depending on the battery voltage at the end of a 10 min.', u'battery test (battery at rest).', u'This battery test is first done at the completion of the constant voltage charging stage, and then every 12 hours while in float stage.My experience is that this battery test will NOT detect a battery that has been charged and passed the battery test, but then fails to start the engine the next time, i.e.', u'that fails to hold charge.', u'I am guessing that a longer battery test(at least one hour) might catch batteries that charge up okay, but fail to hold charge.', u'Other battery smart chargers (e.g.', u'CTEK) also have very short test periods, so will probably not catch such batteries either.The other minor disadvantage is that the BatteryMINDer 2012 has a maximum current of only 2 amps, so charging a battery  that is significantly discharged will take some time.', u'This is the third BatteryMINDer I have purchased.', u'The first was the aviation version to keep my aircraft battery peaked due to less frequent flying.', u\"The second has been used in a more utility capacity to service batteries for boats, jet ski's, garden tractors, and auto's.\", u'It has performed well by recovering and maintaining batteries that would otherwise be lost or difficult to revive.', u'This latest version does not seem to have the size and heft of the previous chargers, but when I used it the result was the same.', u'I charged a battery in one of my cars that has been sitting for two to three months with no use.', u'It took 24 to 48 hours before it brought it up to normal levels, and I left it attached for several days.', u'I have to believe it conditioned the battery back to a very serviceable level.', u'It is not a fast recovery charger, but if the advertised capabilities of the charger are accurate it will lengthen the life of my batteries.']\n",

      "[u'I have been impressed with frameless blade technology.', u\"I find that blades featuring this design tend to do a much better job of maintaining contact with the windshield, clearing away rain much more effectively than the older wipers do.These Bosch blades are among the best I've used.\", u'They are well designed and manufactured.', u\"They installed on my old Lexus RX300 without any hassles at all.With these wipers combined with Rain-X treatment on the glass, rain doesn't stand a chance.\", u'The frameless design ensures excellent blade contact.', u'The blade itself is engineered to be durable and highly effective.These Bosch wipers are much better than the Rain-X Latitude wipers they replaced.', u\"In fact, although I properly installed the Rain-X wipers, the driver's side blade fell off of the car because of a manufacturing/design defect where the blade attaches to the wiper arm on the car -- the mounting bracket remained in the wiper arm, but the wiper blade flew off.\", u\"Not the sort of thing you want to have happening on the highway during a rainstorm.Our winter has been mild, so I haven't had the opportunity to see how these perform under winter

one blade for free to test out.', u\"I'm very pleased with this wiper blade, so I bought another one to match.\", u\"I think that's a decent testimonial.The performance in the rain is very good.\", u\"It's quiet and effective.\", u'The last thing I want to think about in wet conditions is whether my wipers are going to do their job or not.The installation is pretty simple.', u\"It's easy enough to remove the old blade and install the new one in under a minute.\", u'The clip is slightly non-standard though.', u\"I'm a little worried that it won't be quite as simple to remove it in the future when I replace it (unless I replace it with the exact same one and can read the instructions on the new package).\", u\"The cover that slides over the clip isn't completely intuitive, so I can imagine having a hard time remembering how it went on.Other than that, this blade performs very well and even looks really nice.Be careful when you select the blades for your vehicle, because your vehicle may require different blades for the driver's and passenger's side.\", u'I drive a pickup truck, so life is a little simpler for me.Also, remember to be careful when you remove the old blades.', u\"Never leave the wiper arm extended if it doesn't have a blade attached.\", u\"It's too easy for the arm to snap back down and shatter your windshield.\", u\"Gently put the arm back in place against the windshield while you're fumbling around with the packaging for the new blade.\", u'I have been using wipers from a well known French brand for years, so I decided to make a change.', u'These work just as well, if not better.', u'The Bosch 24A ICON wiper blade, 24\" fits my Fit, is durable, and was easy to install.', u'It has a powder black finish that matches my wiper arm.I do recommend it.', u\"Good wiper blades are a must if you live where the sun don't shine much.\", u\"Four stars because I prefer OEM parts, but if they weren't available, I'd buy this.\", u'This is the first wiper of this type that I have used (non-hinged frame type) and I have to say that I am impressed.', u'Usually at highway speeds, my regular wipers start to lift a bit or do not maintain full contact with the windshield, but these low profile wipers keep full contact along the full length, for a clear windshield.', u'There was no squeak or stutter at any time, even in light rain or when using washer fluid, and they were able to keep up with a full-on heavy rain, which some wipers do not seem to be able to do.', u'This 24a wiper fits the drivers side of a 2009 Sonata among others (use a 20a for the passenger side of the 2009 Sonata), and works as good or better than any other wiper I have tried so far.', u'Installation was a snap, just following the directions/diagrams on the back of the package.', u'I do not live in an area with snow or ice, so I cannot on this wiper in \"winter\" conditions.', u\"Bosch Icon wipers are great all year long, in the Winter ice and snow doesn't build up like it can on framed wipers, they flex making even contact across the glass with out pressure points.\", u\"I've been very pleased with performanceand life these wiper offer.\", u'They mount on standard wiper arms with a solid grip and stay on once locked down.', u'I clean the edge with a soft cloth and sometimes use a rubber treatment after months of use, I find this keeps thewipers in tip top shape.', u\"I've had these on my car for a little over a year and a half.\", u'(I know, because Amazon just reminded me of my prior order as I checked out the product page to order another set.)', u'Only now are they starting to show signs of aging.', u'Before these, I had wipers from Rain-X (two different kinds) and while they cost about 75% as much, they lasted 30% of the time.', u\"You do the math.In case you're not familiar with them, Bosch is the company that actually makes the OEM wiper blades for many high end cars (like BMW, for one).\", u\"In fact, you'd probably be surprised by how much inside your car is made by Bosch.\", u\"So, you're not buying from a company that is just marketing cheap parts made in China and selling it with a lot of marketing.\", u\"You're getting OEM quality with these, if not better.\", u\"So, when considered in that light, as well, these blades really aren't that expensive.So, the blades really do last, but will you be happy with them while they do?\", u'I think so.', u\"They hold the shape of the windshield well, and never flap or vibrate, no matter how fast you're going.\", u'The bracket is solid, and worked well on the J-hook in my car.', u'Many other \"universal\" mounts didn\\'t work so well, notably the ones from the aforementioned Rain-X wipers.', u\"The single piece design is also great for those living in cold climates, as it is less vulnerable to ice and snow build-up.They don't streak or chatter, and even after having them on my car for over a year, they are only streaking a small amount.Given that your eyes are the most important safety device on your car, you owe it to yourself to not skimp on wiper blades.\", u\"But I'm pleased to report that despite the upfront cost, these are actually MORE cost effective than many other premium wiper blades, given that they are the only expensive wiper blades I've ever used that actually lasted longer than the cheap ones.Tip: the A or the B after the model number (e.g.\", u'22A) refers to the spring force of the blade (i.e.', u'how hard it is to pull it straight).', u'The B applies more force, and would be useful if you have a highly curved windshield.', u'The fact that Bosch offers not just a variety of lengths down the inch, but also two different spring forces, is another indicator of the fact that these are not your average wiper blades.', u'I found that having an A on the driver side and a B on the passenger side works best on my car.', u\"If in doubt, just try A all around, and then if you find that the blade is missing spots on the ends of the blade, return the A and get a B.Last tip: Amazon's database is helpful, but by no means complete.\", u\"If you think this will fit your car, but Amazon says it won't, ignore Amazon.\", u\"They say neither blade I have on my car will work, and yet I'm extremely happy with them, as you can tell.\", u'I bought this 24A ICON wiper for my Frontier and it was real easy to install them.', u'It took more time to take out my old Goodyear wipers that lasted me about 6months.', u'These Bosch wipers run very smooth and no streaks.', u'We will see how long they last me.', u'This is a very light wiper made mostly with composite materials instead of metal parts.', u\"Our MDX requires two different sizes, a 24A and a 21B - the letters correspond to driver's side(A) and passenger's side(B).Replacing wipers is pretty easy.\", u'You may need to look at the instruction as different manufacturers have different ways of releasing them from the hook, but basically takes only thirty seconds to remove the old and snap a new one.', u'For the Bosch Icon wipers, just type in search \"Bosch wiper blades -hook installation video II\" for online video instructions.CAUTION:Be careful when you leave the wiper standing on your windshield after you remove the old one.', u'The wiper is spring loaded, without the wiper it is pure metal and it may snap back to your windshield glass.These wipers look a lot better compared to my old one.', u'It is designed for high speed and supposedly to last 40% longer than conventional types (for that, only time will tell).', u'The softer frame curves and conforms to the shape of the surface glass as opposed to conventional wipers that has two parts - the metal frame and the moving part that is the rubber.', u'Replaced Acura wipers with these.', u'Much better.', u'This is the second set of these I have purchased.', u'First set lasted 4 years.', u'First month of really bad winter , this blade has worked the best Ive had.', u'You really need to have for 6 months before I can tell you if its worth the money.', u'Very expensive.', u'My cheap blades usually only last about 6mo.', u'easy to put on.', u'squeeky clean.', u'works on freeway speeds pretty well.', u'update later.', u'I have a Kia Borrego SUV, and it is a challenge to get wiper blades that actually do a good job on the large windshield.', u'So far, I have been highly pleased with this set of Bosch ICON wiper blades.', u'They are quiet, and work without streaking.', u'I have used them twice during snow storms, and they have done very well.It was easy to find the correct sizes needed, using the parts finder tool at the top of the Amazon page.', u'My spouse installed these on my vehicle, and he said they were not any harder to install than a standard wiper blade.', u'I am very satisfied with these blades, and will likely purchase them the next time I need a replacement.', u'I am a big fan of \"beam\" type wiper blades, which don\\'t have external hinged arms.', u'Not only do they keep a closer contact with the windshield, but they are much less prone to clogging with ice and snow.', u\"I've used earlier versions of the Bosch ICON on my wife's car for a few years and the new style looks to be even better.\", u'The rubber is more supple and there\\'s a subtle \"wing\" air deflector molded into the blade, to help keep it on the glass at high speeds.With a good beam blade installed, you can skip switching to \"winter blades\" if you\\'re in the snow belt - the ICON will do just fine.', u'I also like that they seem to last longer than traditional blades - I usually get a full year out of these.One feature of the ICON I like, so far shared only with theValeo 900-ULTIMATEof blades I have tried, is the hinged cover over the mounting hardware.', u'Not only does this make the blade easy to install, it also makes it easy to remove, unlike those with the spring latch you have to somehow get to release.Do make sure that you get the right size and style for your car.', u'I typically buy Bosch brand wipers, but a few months ago Amazon had a sale on another brand of wipers (Valeo) so I gave them a try.', u'Never again.', u'They broke, had to return them, broke again, etc.', u'So I gave up and went back to Bosch.', u'These are awesome wipers.', u\"Very quiet, don't leave streaks, and are very durable and resistant to ice/snow in the winter.\", u'And they last a long time.', u\"I've gotten at least 2 years on my last pair of these.\", u'They are worth the price.', u'This wiper blade was much harder to install than my old one.', u'It sort of flopped around, getting in the way with the 24\" length until I could get the attachment secured.', u'I have not noticed any difference in wind resistance from my old blades.', u'They do not squeak or stutter or streak after several storms, however, pine needles seem to get stuck in the assembly much easier and have to be removed in order not to have the streaking.They work as well as the old wipers which really cost less, but they do look better.']\n"

but have to admit, that could be wishful thinking.So, in conclusion, think this product leaves some sort of film on the car, and not a glassy one.\", u'There are plenty of options out there at 1/4 the cost, that leave NO film.', u'If you are willing to pay four times the price, suspect you already keep your vehicle waxed, so the dubious benefit of this product containing waxes as protectants, is a waste of money as well as leaving a less that sparkling clean finish on the car.', u'Despite already knowing that washing and waxing go together about as good as trying to stick equal ends of a magnet together, I decided to purchase this to give it a shot.', u'1st, am a huge Meguiars loyalist and I tend to use their professional line up of products due to experience and owning my own automotive detailing business.', u\"2nd:  being in the business of detailing vehicles I've grown accustomed to utilizing the appropriate steps thorought the detail process.\", u'I purchased this for my own vehicle for a trial and error run.', u'One thing that I will say about the product that is positive is if you are tight on time and waxing is not a choice, I would recommend this product for you as something is better than nothing.', u'However, keep in mind that it will not produce the quality of protection or shine that a hand or machine applied proper wax would.', u\"This is due to 2 reasons:  1: you are waxing while washing, the coverage is not as thorough, it's essentially as if you'd wax before washing.\", u\"It's going up break down because it's diluted.\", u'Secondly, a major advantage of a paste or liquid wax is the application of the product itself.', u'You will find much better coverage and masking of paint defects when the right steps are taken.', u'Meaning more shine.', u\"I'm not tryin to deter anyone away from trying this product nor disagreeing with the positive votes.\", u'Just giving some useful feedback about the truth behind the product other than basing my rating off of the fact that it smells good.', u'I wash my cars often so when I use a \"regular\" wash soap, I usually dry the car then apply a quik spray wax(wipe on wipe off)When I don\\'t have much time, but want to wash my cars, I use Meguiars Wash & Wax.I\\'m not sure how much wax protection is actually left on the car versus regular waxing or the various quik spray waxes out there.I do know that using this soap does make drying of the car a tad quicker....other then that, I don\\'t think it\\'s better than the other Megs soaps avail.It creates nice suds, cleans good, has a nice scent to it as well.For me, this soap is kind of reduntant as i like to use a quik wax after washing.I bought 2 bottles and will not be buying more as I prefer a \"regular\" wash soap like Meguiars Gold Class or Meguiars Hyper wash.']\n"

product that leaves the leather clean and ready to be conditioned.', u'Easy to apply and remove.', u'I was very satisfied with the results.', u'The Lexol pH cleaner worked extremely well to clean automotive leather upholstery and surfaces.', u'Just follow the instructions on the bottle and it does a fantastic job.', u\"Always use the pH cleaner before you apply the Lexol conditioner since you don't want to apply new oils over existing dirt.\", u'The pH cleaner comes out as a clear liquid that is more viscous than water.', u'I recommend using a terry cloth sponge to create more lather than just using a cotton cloth or terry cloth.', u'I have tried several over the counter leather cleaner/conditioners and Lexol beats them all.Pros: Cleans leather without drying it.', u'Very easy to use.Cons: The product is a bit expensive and hard to find compared to the over-the-counter products, but it should be the only product to buy and Amazon carries it!Overall: If you own any leather accessories or cars with leather interiors, Lexol pH cleaner and Lexol conditioner should be on your list.', u'LEXOL IS THE BEST SRAY FOR CLEANING LEATHER SEATS IN YOU AUTOMOBILE AND KEEPING THEM FROM

this by some Porsche owners who swear by it and I completely understand why.', u'Non greasy, just great stuff!Cheers There are so numerous spray leather cleaner and conditioner out there and I was curious to see how different they are.Here are my findings:1.', u'All 5 spray leather cleaner and conditioner are priced between $7-9 for a 16 FL ounce bottle.', u'This one is actually 16.9 FL OZ and

u'The spray nozzle is the nicest and best (big, sturdy, fine mist) of all the spray bottles I have tried.5.', u'Since this is a cleaner only, you should follow with a leather conditioner (also stated on the back of the bottle), which I find a bit of a hassle.', u\"I'm a busy working mom and prefer to use a leather cleaner and conditioner in ONE, such as as the WhooHoo-CleanLeather Conditioner and Cleaner in One.\", u'Luxurious Leather Lotion for Your Designer and Fine Leather Goods.', u'Protect Your Leather Investment.', u'15 FL OZ.', u'Made in USA!.6.', u\"Because it's in a spray format, it's good for large leather items such as a sofa, which I used it for.\", u'For smaller and more expensive leather goods, I prefer to use the WhooHoo-Clean leather care.', u'If I pay several hundred or thousands of dollars for a leather item, I want to keep it new looking for a long time!In my opinion, any real leather can and will benefit from a good leather care product (with high customer reviews!).', u'Think about it, leather is like skin, it will get dry with time and particularly usage.', u'Just pick one that fits your budget and use it regularly!', u'This company was recommended by the people who installed the leather seats in my truck.', u'It seems to clean the leather pretty well without being too sticky or messy.', u\"I use this product on the car's leather seats.\", u'The seats are a tan color and really show dirt and stains.', u'This product cleans them up nice.', u\"In the past I've ruined leather because I was not aware that household cleaners or even other cleaners that are supposedly for leather do not have the proper pH to care for leather.\", u'They end up damaging the leather and/or soaking into the pores of the leather and clogging them, making the leather tacky and shortening the life of it.This is not the case with this Lexol cleaner.', u'It is the correct pH so will not harm leather.', u'Further, it seems to help feed and treat the leather as it gently cleans.I have noticed a difference!', u'The leather seems healthier after using this product for sure.', u'Unless I hear about something better in the future, I will swear by this stuff for all of my leather furniture and car upholstery.Note, on the bottle it states - \"Not intended for stain removal.\"', u\"So, please don't expect this product to remove stains.\", u\"It's more of a general routine leather cleaner.\", u'It does clean, because when using a white cloth, I notice some dirt on the cloth while using this.Also, a tip from a leather pro I know-wait 30 minutes after using this before applying a conditioner.', u'This will allow the leather to fully dry.']\n"

      "[u'This is not my first Bissell carpet cleaner.', u\"I previously owned one of Bisell's ProHeat 2x models.\", u'Like that model, this DeepClean Premier cleans carpet through water extraction.', u'It sprays a water/cleaner solution on the carpet and then extracts the (now dirty) water as you make subsequent passes over the carpet.I got this unit after my old one stopped working.', u'I had it for several years, but used it only once or twice a year in three average/small rooms, so to me it failed prematurely.', u'The sprayer failed, which apparently was a frequent occurrence on the older models.', u'I am hoping this one is better in that regard.I loved the way the ProHeat cleaned my carpets, and the DeepClean does the same fantastic job.aThe box includes the cleaner (needs minor assembly), and a trial size bottle of Bissell cleaning solution.', u'The cleaner weighs about 24 pounds.', u'Assembly is simply a matter of attaching the handle with two supplied screws, and then attaching part of the electrical cord holder, which is a plastic piece which secures with one screw.', u'The electrical cord is approximately 22 feet long.', u\"The cleaner's path is a foot wide.\", u'It also includes a small job tool, which Bissell calls the Stain Tool, which is 3 inches wide and mounts on the sprayer/hose, like you might mount a handtool on a vacuum cleaner.', u'The unit has a carrying handle to help lift it when you wish to carry it.', u'The front does not have any sort of cushioned bumper.The tank on this model is about 25% larger than my old ProHeat.', u'It is a similar tank, combining a bladder for reclaimed, dirty water, and a tank for clean water/solution mixture.', u'Since you have to stop and empty the dirty water when the bladder is full, a bigger tank is better.The cleaning head is a lot like the one on the ProHeat.', u'It is basically a roller with rows of brushes on it (in this case 10 rows), similar to a vacuum cleaner.The DeepClean Premier does NOT have an on board heater that you can shut on and off, as did the ProHeat.', u\"However, the DeepClean uses Bissell's new Heatwave technology.\", u'Sound fancy?', u\"Actually it is a cleaver design, where heat generated from the cleaner's motor is channeled to the bottom of the water tank and the brush areas.Directions are pretty simple.\", u'Pre-treat if you have some tough stains.', u'Fill the clean water tank by unlatching the top and adding 5 ounces of cleaner to the bladder tank.', u\"If you fill the included measuring cup twice, that's 5 ounces.\", u'Fill the tank the rest of the way with hot tap water (NO boiling/microwaved water!).', u'Then reattach the top of the tank, and plug in the cleaner.', u'Turn it on and you are ready to clean!As you pass over the carpet, you press the trigger to activate the sprayer.', u'This wets the carpet with the cleaning solution.', u'Take your time and do not saturate the carpet.', u'Periodically empty the dirty water from the tank.', u'When you are done cleaning, you should check the tank and remove any debris.It is recommended that you perform a rinse step on the carpet, passing over the entire carpet with just water in the unit to rinse it and remove any additional dirt or cleaner residue.I found that the unit cleans just as well as my old ProHeat.', u\"You will likely see some color come back into your carpets, and you'll see a lot of dirt come out.\", u'I have some light colored carpets which are 10 year or so old, and after I clean with this unit, they look close to new again.', u'You can really see the difference and how dingy your carpets may have become over time.', u'In our house, we vacuum every day, but its not the same as a good water extraction cleaning.You can add accessories like hand tools and a hard floor cleaner, which is like a rubber squeegee which attaches to the unit.The warranty on this unit is three years.I would highly recommend this model.', u'It does an excellent job cleaning carpets, just as well as I have seen by professional cleaners.', u\"About the only cleaner I have seen outdo the ProHeat, and now the DeepClean, is Bissell's own Big Green Deep Cleaning Machine, but that costs a lot more than the DeepClean, and frankly unless you are going to be cleaning your carpets by water extraction more than once a month, this one will get the job done very nicely.\", u'I would opt for the Big Green model only if you are doing very frequent/heavy duty cleaning, in a huge house with lots of carpets where that machine will help cut time, or if you are cleaning office carpets, etc.', u\"I'm a big fan of Bissell products since they seems to excel at offering decent quality at a decent price, and have found their customer service to be excellent.\", u\"I have their SpotBot (can't live without it), their Healthy Home vac (my favorite upright) and a few others.\", u'But when it comes to carpet shampooing, Hoover is still the best in my opinion.This Bissell is certainly no slouch.', u'The build quality is quite good for the price - nice heft to most plastic parts, especially the ones that get the most use (water dispenser and collection bins).', u'The ergonomics are good.', u'I did fumble a bit with the water collection bin at first, but a little practice and everything comes apart and goes back together without much fuss.', u'Assembly was very straightforward and simple.This is a pretty traditional carpet shampooer, which is a good thing - some of the novel approaches Bissell has tried in the past have fell short of the mark.', u'As with pretty much any such device, you dispense cleaning solution onto the carpet, have the machine agitate it with the brush, and then vacuum up the dirty water.This does not have a water heater per se, but, as with some Hoover models, it channels the warm exhaust from the motor to help heat and dry the carpet.', u\"To be honest, I can't tell if that feature is of any value on any machine that has had it - the effects are more on the subtle rather than dramatic side.Where the Bissell falls short is the roller bar.\", u'It uses a conventional roller, much like you would see in a regular vacuum cleaner.', u'It works, but the rotating brush design of most of the Hoover models is much more effective.', u'The roller bar does not offer enough agitation to loosen and remove dirt compared with the rotating brushes.On the plus side, the roller bar is easier to clean afterwards versus the Hoover rotating brushes, especially if you are dealing with pet hair or loose fibers.Another area where Bissell trumps Hoover is with the cleaning solution.', u\"Every Bissell solution I've used has been great.\", u\"Hoover solution has ranged from just OK to poor.The Bissell has a lot going for it but, if you're looking for the absolute best when it comes to cleaning power, Hoover still is the champ.\", u\"I'd suggest cross-shopping some of the mid-priced Hoovers (the ones with the Clean Surge feature) rather than their top of the line models.\", u\"We've used a few stain products on various spots on our carpet with some success, but some spots did not come out.\", u'Used this machine, using the included pro solution, hot water, and going back and forth over the spots, nearly completely erased them.The machine itself is quite simple, two sets of brushes, vacuum (to suck off excess water), and the tank itself.', u\"There is also a mechanism to keep the water hot, although I haven't used this machine long enough to know how well that works.\", u'The fresh water/solution tank and old/dirty tanks are one and the same, the fresh water is in a bladder, the old water goes back in around it (on the outside of the bladder).', u'This is a clever solution that allows the machine to carry more water, and it works quite well, was amazed at how much time I could run it.The machine also comes with a spot wand, which dispenses solution, vacuum, and has some bristles.', u'It works fairly well, although only for places the machine itself cannot get (like furniture).Solution is a bit expensive, but it adds scotch guard back to the carpets if you use the bissell higher end solutions.', u'If you have carpets in your home, then you likely need to deep clean them more often than you think.', u\"Simple vacuuming gets up dust, but plenty gets in there (even if you don't wear shoes indoors), so owners of homes with carpets will need to rent carpet deep cleaners sometimes.\", u\"Of course, renting doesn't help for the house with kids where stained carpets happen all too often (or with pets), so owning a machine such as this one can be invaluable.I was impressed with the power of this machine for price.\", u'The commercial machines you rent are considerably bigger and heavier, but this one seems to accomplish much of that power in a much smaller package.', u'When you get the Deep Clean Premier, you will need to assemble it.', u'This is a simple matter of inserting the handle, hose rack, and attaching 3 screws.', u'The cleaner comes with a bottle of cleaner (enough for about 1.5 fillings).', u'The cool thing is that the clean water tank is a bladder inside the waste water tank.', u'As the clean detergent is sprayed out, the bladder shrinks and the waste water takes the volume on the other side of the bladder.', u'I was skeptical, but it worked quite well.I definitely recommend you pre-vacuum.', u'This is a powerful machine, but I found that clumps of carpet were getting left behind by the vacuum.', u'I suspect this was dust that was too thick for the vacuum to get.', u\"The beaters are quite aggressive so I wouldn't recommend you use this on a valuable or fragile rug.\", u'There is no height adjustment on them (or speed/sensitivity adjustment), so if you have a nice rug, this might not be the best choice.Overall, I was impressed by the simplicity of the tool and the strength of the suction.', u'I was also disgusted by the color of the water, which I suppose is a sign it pulled out some nasty stuff from the carpet.', u\"I do wish there were height adjusters on the beaters and perhaps a flow control, but overall it's a good package which will help keep your home clean.\", u'4 stars.', u'Off the bat, I love this product and my carpet, house, and nose are happier for owning it.', u'I thought I\\'d share some brief experience with using this in a situation that is explicitly documented as \"not to do\" with the DeepClean Premier Upright Deep Cleaner.', u'First, it was trivial to put together (basically screw on the handle and parts bracket) and worked fine right out of the box with the included sample 2x cleaning liquid.We have 4 cats and a dog.', u'All shed to small degrees, and one cat is part Persian (the hairy part) and drops huge clumps of fine white hair everywhere.', u'The directions state that you should vacuum all debris up BEFORE using the DeepClean Premier.', u'I did that.', u'Sort of.', u\"Meaning I didn't do it very well as an experiment because sometimes you're in a hurry.Where this was used on plain carpet (short not shag) the fluid went down perfectly, was sucked up perfectly, and dried pretty thoroughly in a couple of hours (humidity was low that day).\", u\"But where we missed getting debris (animal hair) the DeepClean did two things: It clogged up and didn't spray well, and it ended up just throwing soggy hair balls around.Cleaning out the clogged up parts wasn't too difficult, but I needed a very thin knife blade to get into some narrow crevices to scoop out soggy hair clumps.\", u\"It didn't appear there was any damage and the brushes were still rotating smoothly.\", u'There was no burning rubber smell that happens when the belt seizes on the motor.So, just some experience.', u'I kind of did this all on purpose as a test of the machine, to push its limits.', u\"Follow the directions, and you'll get fairly hassle free clean and clean smelling carpet.\", u\"Be sloppy in your pre-vacuum and you'll end up spending the time you SHOULD have used in vacuuming better to clean out your cleaner.A great product nonetheless, and the rooms I used this on following all directions are spotless and smell great!\", u\"I got my first carpet cleaner less then a year ago, but I've grown quite familiar with them as this is now my third.\", u\"I got this unit for a second house I own... not a very old house, but it's used for various 'get-togethers' and has off-white carpeting.\", u'The carpets have gotten quite dirty and were in desperate need of a good cleaning.First, the instructions are actually exceptional... my wife, who never setup our other two cleaners, found setting this cleaner up to be very easy with the detailed manual.', u\"Cleaning with it was easy at the beginning, but halfway though my wife found the unit's weight to be fighting against her... as time went on, she grew increasingly tired and found the cleaner to be more and more cumbersome.\", u'I used it for a hallway section and found it to be about as heavy and maneuverable as my current favor cleaner, the Hoover Power Scrub Deluxe Carpet Washer, when both are filled with water (the Hoover is lighter when empty, but holds more water).', u'In the end, the Bissell cleaner did a FANTASTIC job on our carpets... they look brand new again.Emptying and washing out the waste water container was quite easy... something my wife was very happy about after wrestling with this unit for some time.', u\"We both had the same single complaint about this unit though: the clean water and shampoo is kept in a bladder inside the waste water container, so when the waste water container begins filling up, you can't tell how much clean water you have left.Comparing to the Hoover Power Scrub Deluxe Carpet Washer, FH50150 ([...]):Both are roughly the same price (the Hoover is currently a bit cheaper on Amazon).1) The Hoover uses two tanks... one for clean and one for dirty water, so the levels are very visible.\", u\"As mentioned, the Bissell uses a bladder within a tank, so it's difficult to see the amount of clean water left.\", u'You have to estimate how much is left by how much waste water is in the tank... something that will become more familiar in time.', u\"Cleanup is easier with the Bissell, but the Hoover wins here in my opinion.2) The Hoover keeps the water and shampoo separated and is mixed as you use the cleaner, so you can switch from wash to rinse on the fly... huge advantage here for the Hoover as the bissell's bladder must be emptied and refilled with fresh water in order to rinse your carpet.3) The Bissell's upholstery attachment has a hose that's slightly longer then the Hoover's (9' vs 8').\", u\"The Hoover comes with several attachments for upholstery and stairs, while the Bissell comes with a single 'upholstery/tough stain' tool.\", u'Both seem to do an equally impressive job on upholstery, so the advantage here goes to Hoover for the variety of attactments.4) The Hoover uses five small rotating discs with brushes to clean carpets while the Bissell uses two horizontal spinning cylinders with brushes (similar to a vacuum).', u\"I haven't compared them side by side, but just the way the unit feels when cleaning and watching the way the brushes scrub the carpet, I'd give a big advantage to the Bissell's system.\", u'The Bissell clearly does a better job getting down in deep into the carpet.', u\"The Hoover got our colored carpets very clean, but the Bissell got our off-white carpets spotless and looking brand new.Currently, the Hoover is at my home where it's used 60% for upholstery and 40% carpets (w/stairs).\", u\"The Bissell is at a second house where it's used 80% for carpets (no stairs) and 20% for upholstery.\", u\"I would say it's the perfect matchup... the Hoover has various attachments for use on upholstery and stairs, while the Bissell's strong point is by far its carpet deep-cleaning abilities.\", u\"If I could only keep one, I would stick with the Hoover due to it's ability to switch between wash and rinse on the fly... that option is just way too convenient to live without.\", u'If you plan to clean mostly carpets that need a serious deep-cleaning, I would recommend the Bissell quite highly.']\n"

      "[u'I had the opportunity to evaluate a Bissell DeepClean unit.', u'Previously, we had used a Hoover product to clean the carpets in our home.', u'The Bissell is a better unit.The process of filling and cleaning the water/solution and waste water tanks is straightforward and not difficult.', u\"The unit itself, although somewhat large from front to back, isn't unwieldy.\", u\"It is like a vacuum cleaner with a long base, but it isn't wider.\", u'It is lighter than the Hoover we have.As for effectiveness, the unit did a great job on our carpets.', u'After vacuuming, we ran it over the carpet according to the technique explained in the directions.', u'It pulled all kinds of filth out.', u\"The tanks and seals didn't leak, unlike the Hoover.\", u'The only oddity about this cleaner is that it seemed to spit out some hairballs, which look like they are composed of carpet fibers and cat hair.', u\"We have cats, so that isn't entirely surprising.\", u\"Still, we had to clean up those small bundles of fibers where the machine deposited them on the carpet.We have a separate spot cleaner, so we haven't tried using this unit's feature that allows you to take the active cleaning parts of the machine off to use as a portable spot cleaner.In all, this unit did a great job and was relatively easy to use compared to the Hoover we had.\", u\"I recommend that you check it out if you're looking for a home carpet cleaning machine.\", u'I shaved off a star but wish it could be a 1/2 star.', u'I explain why below.', u'But first I must say this is great performer.', u'Plenty of capacity in the water/solution tank and plenty of capacity in the dirty water tank.', u'The width of the cleaning path is great.', u'The sound volume of the motor is excellent.', u'It is pretty solid for a mostly plastic machine.', u'The ability to have an easy to push self contained upright is great, even better with a lift off unit to focus on concentrated spills, furniture and your car.', u\"The hand held nozzle attachment/hose rolls up neatlyWhy I took off a point is as follows: The fresh water tank is a little clumsy and I didn't see a separate measuring area for the solution.\", u\"My older Bissell upright (I believe model 25) was better in that department, but it didn't clean as well as this one and the capacities of fresh and dirty water are much less.\", u'The cord, while easy to wind up, seems shorter than my much cheaper upright.Despite my nitpicking, this is an excellent machine and I highly recommend it.', u'Bissell did a great job with this.', u'This is a good carpet cleaner and I love the fact that it has a removable unit to do spot cleaning on stairs and upholstery.', u'It was very easy to assemble, and quite light.', u'You clean by pulling backwards, much like a Rug Doctor.', u'It did a good job of cleaning my carpets, and picked up quite a good amount filth my dog left behind.', u'The water I dumped out was quite dirty.', u\"We had a good amount of rain these past few weeks so my carpets were long overdue for a cleaning.As with any carpet cleaner, don't go over the area more than 2x in a day.\", u'You do not want the pad underneath to get saturated with water.', u'You will have to do multiple cleanings in multiple days in order to get tougher stains out.', u\"Use a pre-treater, wash carpet, let it dry, and then go over it again.If I didn't own a Rug Doctor, or a Spot Bot, I would definitely give this higher marks.\", u'It does a good job cleaning, but the tank is too small for my house to do a thorough cleaning without stopping to add water constantly.', u\"It is a good carpet cleaner in its price range, and if you don't have a need for something with commercial power like a Rug Doctor, I would say go for this one.\", u'Mine is a four cat household, two of whom are 17+ years old.', u\"Don't judge; nobody intends to be a crazy cat lady.Carpet cleaning has become a way of life and makes a huge diffence in the air quality in my home.\", u'I have both an Atlantis and a Bissell Pet Bot.', u'Both are great products, but both have limitations.', u'The Atlantis is a huge canister gizmo and an equally huge nuisance to get out for use; the Pet Bot is terrific, but only cleans a six inch circle at a time.', u\"I'm thrilled with this Bissell Upright Deep Cleaner.The handle is relatively easy to attach, and much easier than putting together a set of bookshelves.\", u\"It's obvious when the screws are in the right place, even though you can't see where they're going.\", u'The directions clearly state to use a large long handle Philips screwdriver.', u\"You can't fail!There's a bit of a learning curve on operating and I have a couple of nits to pick, but I still love this machine.\", u\"It makes a horrendous amount of noise, and the dirty water container doesn't always plop into place correctly, which means the water won't heat.\", u\"It's difficult to tell how much cleaning solution is left, and the dirty water container seems unnecessarily large.\", u\"The dirty water container is also sealed with a couple of openings which makes it hard to clean, and there's a long plastic piece inexplicably floating around in my unit.\", u\"It doesn't seem to affect operation, though and I'm very satisfied with the effort/result ratio in regards to my rugs.This carpet cleaner is well-balanced and doesn't take a lot of strength or time to use.\", u'A couple of passes over an area of rug is enough.', u'The rug is not saturated, just damp, and dries in a couple of hours.', u\"On a really heavily soiled area, I've elected to do several regular cleanings over several days, rather than go over and over the same area at one time.\", u'This seems to work well.', u\"The Bissell will not do as thorough a job as a professional carpet cleaner with a single use, but it's much more cost effective.\", u\"I could have paid for the Bissell with two and a half professional carpet cleanings, and I think using it more frequently will keep my carpets as clean as an infrequent professional cleaning.The lift-off spot cleaner is perfect for cleaning upholstery, though I haven't used it for that yet.\", u'I have used the pedal to release the unit and used it for cleaning the fringe on an area rug, and it worked just fine.', u\"You can fold the rug back on itself and work in a straight line so the strings don't get caught in the machine.I'm very, VERY pleased with every Bissell product I've owned, and this one meets the high standard I've come to expect.\", u'Now, if I just knew where that plastic piece was supposed to go...', u'I have two kids, 3 dogs and a cat and my life gets messy.', u'Really messy.', u'So I was excited to try this Bissell Lift off.', u\"I already have the Hoover MaxExtract all Terrain and was mostly happy with it's performance, except for the upholstery tool - suction just wasn't as good and you still had to lug the entire machine around, and up and dodwn the stairs to clean the stairs.\", u'The Bissell lift-off solves that problem - you just pop the cleaner section off the base and take it to whatever you want to clean.', u'I have done both my cars, my couch and the stairs - and this is absolutely perfect for that and makes all those tasks so much easier.', u\"Suction is amazing and leaves the couch barely damp after cleaning - which is important because I used to rarely clean the sofa because I didn't want to wait all day for it to dry.\", u\"When I first got it, I was disappointed that the hand tool didn't have rotated brushes like the Hoover MaxExtract hand tool does and thought I would probably end up ordering one, but after using it I don't think it's necessary.\", u'The included hand tool works great on everything.', u\"I also have a Bissell little green machine, which was worthless and I will now be giving away due to it's poor suction.\", u\"The lift-off is miles above the little green machine in cleaning performance and suction.As an upright cleaner, this also does a very good job - comparing it to the Hoover MaxExtract all-terrain, I'd have to say it is performance is about the same.\", u\"However, with the Hoover I could be lazy and not vacuum first and it would pull up most of the hair and debris into the dirty water tank, the Bissell's design is slightly different so that larger debris and dog hair doesn't get pulled into the dirty water tank - it gets deposited in clumps on the carpet.\", u'So you definitely do need to vacuum before shampooing or be prepared to pick up the hair clumps.', u'Technically all shampooers require vacuuming first, so this is to be expected.', u\"I was skeptical that the two brushrolls on the Bissell could do as good a job as the Hoover's 6 spinning brushes, but it does.\", u\"On carpets, I really can't tell a difference between the two.\", u'Another bonus with the Bissell lift off is that it does heat the water in the tank to keep it hot throughout the cleaning process.', u'but this leads me to a few minor quibbles...I wish the clean water tank was slightly larger - It is just barely large enough to do a small room before it has to be refilled.', u'I can see why they did this from a design standpoint - both tanks have to be small enough to carry the pod around, and also because the clean water tank sits on the heater part which leaves less room for a larger tank.', u'The dirty water tank is quite a bit bigger than the clean water tank.', u'I thought I would really hate having to stop and refill it frequently, but surprisingly, I dont mind it so much.', u\"It's a minor thing.Also, some people have said the dirty water tank is hard to empty, but it's really not - if you flip the handle all the way back and down (it seems like it won't go past the corners, but it does) then the entire top section can be lifted off so that you can dump the tank.As far as which one do I like best, the Bissell Lift-off or the MaxExtract dual-v. it's a toss up.\", u'I love the portable piece of the Bissell and the amazing job it does on stairs and uphosltery and how easy it is to carry it around to whatever you want to clean.', u\"However the Hoover can also do hard floors, which the Bissell can't.\", u'So it really depends on what you need most - multi-surface, or portable upholstery cleaner.', u\"I like both, and will probably keep both around for different jobs, but I am absolutely in love with the Bissell as a portable cleaner, since I haven't found anything else that does as good a job.\", u'I have another BISSELL carpet shampooer and it actually does a better job at carpets than this Lift-Off Cleaner.', u'However, overall I like this BISSELL DeepClean Lift-Off Upright Deep Cleaner as much or better.', u'Our carpets do not get that dirty so even though this Lift-Off model does not clean as well as the dedicated carpet shampooer, the Lift-Off feature really has won me over.', u'The Lift-Off unit is really handy for cleaning carpeted stairs, couches and chairs and similar.', u'With the dedicated carpet shampooer, it has a long hose with a similar brush head but much more difficult to use than the Lift-Off unit.', u'If you do a lot more spot cleaning than overall carpet cleaning then this might be the perfect deep cleaner for you.', u'I was also surprised that it came almost completely assembled and you only have to attach the handle with a couple screws.', u'I really like BISSELL products, they have been very reliable and BISSELL customer service is always very friendly and helpful.', u'Keep in mind though that these are not commercial carpet cleaners but great for normal home usage even where you have pets.', u'My 10 year old carpet looks new again.', u\"With six pets in the house, that's really saying something.This machine took care of several stains that a professional cleaning did not.\", u'I used the cleaner that came with the machine - but less than the 2 ounces the directions called for.', u'(I remembered a conversation with a professional carpet cleaner who told me that home carpet cleaning machines often deposit too much soap in the carpet and that causes it to get dirty faster.)', u'I also added one cup of vinegar to help deodorize.', u'I came to the conclusion that the extraction process is even more important than the soap dispensing process.', u'I spent a lot of time going back and forth, in every direction possible.', u'I think that process is really what made the biggest difference with my carpet.The only thing that surprised me was how often I had to fill the soap/water/vinegar tank.', u'The tank is quite small, so keep that in mind when cleaning.', u\"To do an 16' X 28' room, I filled the tank six or seven times.\", u'(I emptied the dirty water tank two times.)', u'Drying time was as expected.', u'I waited 48 hours to move furniture back in, but could done it sooner.', u'No fans, just an open window and dry weather conditions.I have one room left and then I will tackle the stairs using the lift-off feature.']\n"

      "[u'Charges without fear of overcharging.', u'Does a great job of maintaining my battery in perfect condition in all conditions.', u'Super compact unit with ample cord length.', u'Highly recommended!', u'I bough this because I have a Honda accord that a track and sits in the garage all winter.', u'I need something to keep my Otpima red top charged and this does the job perfectly!!', u'No issues and highly recommend it!!!', u'I do not know if this is any better than any other but I have 4 of them and have given several as presents.', u'This works on all types of batteries and even my 2009 BMW motorcycle when BMW says it will not.Good product I am using this device to trickle charge 2 scooters, a Honda & a Yamaha.', u\"The quick connectors (which I haven't installed yet) are great and will make make this process of switching from one scooter to another much easier.\", u'I highly recommend this charger.', u'EXPERIENCE: I have found this charger to be pretty cool!', u'First of all, it was packaged well from Amazon.com, they like to use the air pocket material for packing, which works great, and is less messy then foam peanuts.', u'The charger comes inside a plastic packaging case with both alligator and permanent wiring connectors.', u'It also comes with a warrantee slip and a paper manual.', u'The first thing I noticed was how light weight the charger is, right around 3-LBS, as opposed to my heavy 8-LBS fast charger counterpart.I really like the cables the charger comes with, the alligator clip ends are made of actual copper, which as you know, allow for better conductivity, which is why copper is used on computer heat sinks to dissipate heat.', u'This particular wire also includes an 7.5-AMP inline fuse, with a cover over it to keep water out.', u'At the other end of the wire uses a proprietary connector system, so that you can disconnect it from the charger incase of emergency, without the need to unplug the charger!The permanent style wire, uses your typical battery bolt type connectors, which allow you to permanently install the charger, for year round use.', u'This also uses a 7.5-AMP inline fuse, and also uses the proprietary connector at the other end.', u'All I had to do to hook it up was, connect the alligators to the battery, connect the other end to the charger output wire, and then plug in the power, that simple!The first thing I saw was a steady \"RED\" light, to indicate that the charger was charging the battery.', u'However, since my battery was at 12-volts at the get go, it didn\\'t take long for the charger to start flashing the \"GREEN\" light, which indicates battery at 80% charged.', u'Remember, a fully charged battery will actually show 13.5 to 14.5 volts.', u'So, it took a while, charging at a 1.2-AMP interval, to get my battery there.TIP: With a lot of modern day vehicles, they have onboard systems which have a low power draw off the battery at all times while the vehicle is sitting.', u'This is unfortunate, as the charger only charges at a 1.2-AMP interval, any onboard systems sucking that amount, will keep the charger from charging your battery.', u'In this particular case, it is best to disconnect your battery from your vehicle.Once my battery was charged, it went into float mode.', u'You know when its in float mode, when the \"RED\" light goes off and the \"GREEN\" light stays on steady.', u'At this point of time, it is not putting a charge on my battery.', u'But it will wait till it drops due to the freezing temperature, and then it will kick back on till its charged again.', u'Think of it like the furnace in your home, the heater comes on when the temperature falls, and turns off when the temperature reaches your set temp setting.CONCLUSION: My fast charger would always be very warm when I used it, but the BTPLUS is only luke warm, you hardly even notice it!', u'My fast charger also emitted a noticeable loud humming sound, my BTPLUS emits a sound so quiet, that you have to put your ear up to the charger to hear it!', u'My fast charger has the ability to cook a battery and destroy it, where as the BTPLUS will maintain my battery and make it last a long time.', u'Sometimes people think that speed is everything, I say no, cause when it comes to batteries, slower is better.', u'The way I look at it is, this is an awesome charger, and I recommend it with 5-stars!', u'Have used it to charge my Beemer.', u'Good unit, I believe the OEM BMW unit is also a rebranded Deltran.', u'I fried the first one by plugging it into a 220V outlet and bought a second one with no hesitation.', u'This is Battery Tender\\'s \"smart\" charger which can be used with the new AGM battery technology - which is exactly why I bought it.', u'It works great and my seasonal sports car (allergic to ice and snow) will require fewer batteries now.', u'This is the best product of its type on the market.', u'I tried the Same, model BMW had made for their Parts Department.', u'Even with a discount and the BMW Sticker and a Car Club Discount, Not the Same as the Real Thing.', u'(Returned it Promptly back to BMW)Amazon.com comes through again!', u'The Battery Tender has all the Features for your Car, Bike or Outdoor Equipment!', u\"The Extra Battery Connectors were first to get added to my cart, then the 25' Extension.\", u'It also has traditional Clamp on Clips for regular jobs.', u'Much More flexible for long term needs of a Car Nut, Motorcycle Nut or anything else that has a Battery!', u'12V and Stored most of the time.', u'Perfect to leave in Float Mode and the Battery life will definitely be extended.I am going to wire up everything I own and permanently wire them for a Battery Tender, Even the Generator!Bought a Battery Tender Bag to keep all of the Accessories, GREAT Engineering and Options!', u'I will one day own a wall mount to power my entire collection of Toys!Enjoy!BatmanDSM I have used Battery Tender chargers for decades now.', u'The product is always well-made and reliable.', u'It can handle any battery and is great for batteries being stored long-term for maintaining a charge.', u'I use it in my garage to keep the motorcycle battery charged during the winter.', u'Highly recommended.', u'Works great!', u\"Had one from Griot's and it fried 3 batteries before I figured out it was the charger, not the batteries.\", u'Bought this one and it The &#34;Battery Tender 021-0128 Battery Tender Plus 12V Battery Charger&#34; is a best buy.', u'It does everything they say it will do.', u'The add for it is not over blown and it did bring my battery back to life.', u'I am really glad I got it; I bought this for my 1996 Harley and found this to be the best battery tender.', u'It works great and keeps my battery conditioned over a long Pennsylvania winter!', u\"When spring comes my bike's battery is ready to go.\", u'I have owned this product for about 2 years and it is great.', u'It is so simple to use and has the connections necessary to use on different batteries.', u'My uncle ended up buying this exact one for his tractor and trolling motor on his boat.', u'He is also impressed by the quality!', u\"I've had one for years on my Harley FatBoy.\", u'I got 7 years out of the HD battery cus this thing is always on the bike when the bike is parked in the garage, a fantastic product, low cost top quality.', u'It keeps the battery in perfect shape, always.', u'It does everything claimed by the mfg.', u'I have even used it in an emergency once for my car battery, where I left something on inside the car all week without realizing, battery was dead, rather then jump and possible cause a problem in the newer cars with damaging all the electronics in the car I put the Deltran on for a couple of hours and it brought the battery back to life to start the car.', u'This tiny thing charged up an Audi A6 battery which is enormous, and it paid for itelf over time by keeping my HD batttery good for 7 years!!!', u'And bike batterys sit around unused a lot more than a car does.', u\"Fantastic product, it is teh best out there too, other brand chargers have issues, these don't.\", u'Perfect This is a good little charger.. no bullcrap .. you just plug it in and it kicks butt.. i like it :-) At the time when I bought this I only had once motorcycle.', u'Now I have two and with I bought the one with multiple ends.', u'I would recomend to anyone who want to keep a battery on standby and not be dead when you go to try to start it.', u'I loved the connections that came with this the easy on and off .', u'I use these on many vehicles and usually buy the cheap harbor freight ones .', u'However I spent up for this for my prize motorcycle .', u'I have it plugged into a battery backup for tv equipment .', u'It stopped working and has a burning smell into it .', u'Customer Service said they would replace it if I sent it in .', u'It is 7 months old but was only put in service for the past week as I had so many others .', u'Thbey scared me saying they often find user error .', u'What could I have done ?', u\"I couldn't treat it better .\", u\"Because it is under a year they said to send in in at my expense and the turnaround is 7- 10 days if they don't determine user error .\", u\"That's scarey .I still find trusting people is best and I will take the time and expense to send it in though many companies just replace things .\", u\"I can see why they do not this isn't a cheap piece of equipment .\", u'I was very happy for the 7 months ( week it worked ) and I love their quick disconnect plug , sadly I may have lost my battery as it could of broke anytime since it was put in service .', u'I know it was working when first hooked up  .', u'Because I value my equipment so much I am going trust this was a fluke and  buy a extra one to have as I am disabled and these save batteries on vehicles that rarely are driven .', u'I am a little disappointed I had a failure so quick again it was in the first week of use after I stored my purchase since Jan 2013  .', u'Failures was the reason I stopped using the Harbor Freight $6 on sale ones but their so cheap I keep a half a dozen at the house and with any hint of a problem put a new one on .', u'I use these devices on several items and would have to replace about 2 harbor freight ones each year .', u'Also  with theirs you do not have that nice disconnect that is so great on snowmobiles , mopeds , or motorcycles .', u'I would even like to have one on the cars and may as they can fit the accessory connectors  .', u'I did expect this to be much more trustworthy but will give it one more chance before I give up .', u\"Though at up to $69 retail that's a lot of money to loose for burning up a few penny capacitor if Lorreta at Deltran is correct .\", u'She said they will go poof if their is any fluctuation in voltage .', u'Nothing else on that circuit or any others had issues at all .', u'It was just placed in service .', u'I will update after sending in .', u'They did not require it verbally when calling in but I will pay the extra money to have it signed for .', u'It helps since it is the first year not to have to pay the $8 inspection fee .', u'You can smell it is burnt .', u'Frustrating , I hate electronic devices because they do often have such high failure rates .Note : it took three weeks and I had to be home to sign for the one sent back which caused me to spend a whole day watching for Fedx but they replaced the bad unit .', u'I had a surge suppressor on the other one and have since upgraded it to another Monster unit that was a daily deal .', u'I also have gone with a 14 kw Kohler generator with a whole whose surge protector .', u\"The electric grid here is going down several times a year and it doesn't look like that is going to turn around anytime soon .\", u'With all the sensitive electronics that are becoming necessities it seems like good defense and being ill having no water , heat , toilets etc is too much .', u\"I had the 'Jr.'\", u\"version of this Battery Tender and for my VT1100 it wasn't sufficient to keep the battery at the ready to start; all it did was prevent battery deterioration and sulfation.\", u\"The 'Plus' model does the battery tickling to prevent self-destruction, but it also charges the battery and keeps it at max for me and ready anytime I want to start the bike, including in the cold weather.\", u'Charges my Harley Streetglide battery flawlessly.', u'I love that it also has a storage mode on it so that you do not overcharge your battery.', u'For the price it is a must have in your home or shop.', u'I have one Battery Tender Plus and love it, No problems with it.', u'Works Great on the quads and motorcycle, Also put it on my electric start generator.', u'I make a habit of every month to swap it from one unit to the other for a couple of days.Till fully charged.', u'All batteries keep at full charge.', u\"Also put it on my pick up and jeep when i don't drive them much.Also i charge the battery in the trailer.\", u'I guess i am to cheap to buy another.', u'But this way i look at the batteries and check.The pick up and Jeep and trailer have big batteries and take a little longer to fully charge.', u'Great unit.A must have and AMAZON has a great price.', u'So, I have both a Battery Tender Plus and a Junior.', u\"They're great devices; I've brought batteries seemingly back from the dead with them when some other chargers I had could not.\", u'However, there are two points worth making:The Junior and Plus have the same logic; they only differ in the maximum charging current.', u'Basically, the Plus will charge a battery up faster.', u\"If you're only using them for storage or you're not in a hurry, save nearly $20 and get the Junior.\", u\"But I expect that you'll be happy with either one.The one complaint I have is with the Warranty.\", u'My Plus stopped working recently.', u\"I'm not sure why; perhaps a power surge or something; it's not like I've ever dropped or abused it.\", u'In any event, since they have a 10 year warranty, I called Deltran up.', u'I can send the unit in (which will cost me $8+ for shipping with some kind of tracking so I can verify that it arrived) and then they charge $17 and change for a \"warranty diagnosic\" and return shipping.', u'So, it basically costs around $25 to get my $40 device serviced under warranty.', u\"It's not a completely unreasonable sum, but if Deltran really had faith in their products, they could easily eat that cost - I think I should at least not have to pay for a diagnostic fee on something under warranty which I've already proven to not work in multiple outlets and on multiple batteries.\", u\"I think I'll just pay the extra $15 to get a brand new one, and use this as a paper weight.But anyway, the products work really well.\", u\"My advice is just to buy this assuming there's really no warranty; as long as that's your expectation, you won't be disappointed.\", u'Bought this to maintain a VMAX battery to work with an inverter.', u\"Seems to be doing it's job correctly.\", u'My spouse has a few of these in the Jr. model, I think.I wanted this plus model, I hate to wait...', u'This charger is just what is needed for those times when your battery is low or dead and you need to get back in the action.Small but large on help for your AUtomotive Battery.', u'Can be used on any type of Automotive Battery.', u\"Even charges and normalizes Deep cycle batteries and won't over charge either.\", u'A real  little Dynamo Very good!', u\"if you don't have one and you are thinking of getting one, just get it!\", u'Bought this to recharge my riding Lawn Mower battery.', u'It has not been run during the winter as my grass is dormant.', u'I tried to start it the other day and it just would not start.', u'It sounded like the battery was getting weak.', u'So I purchased this at a reasonable price and tried it.', u'It charged the battery over night and now it starts just fine.', u'Easy to use.', u'You can leave it attached and after charging the battery, it will switch to the &#34;trickle&#34; mode, keeping the battery charge topped off.', u'A neighbor told me about this - its not a full fledged battery charge, but it offers convenience as I have a number of vehicles that sit idle at times and having a trickle charger without worrying about overcharging is great.', u'This is perfect to keep my battery charged in my dual battery truck that is used seldomit took over 8 hours to load the batteries as I expected not bad for a 1.25a charger I have had motorcycles and cars for years.', u'Keeping the batteries from sulphating is a big problem for other than every day drivers.', u'The technology in the Battery Tender Plus is exactly what I need for the batteries in my classic cars as well as my Harley.', u\"I like it so much that I bought Battery Tender Plus units for my two brothers so that they can keep the batteries alive in their motorcycles too...  Great product and I hope to be able to save some bucks not having to replace batteries as often, not to mention that I can hop on my Harley and take off at a moment's notice...\", u'I plan to use it on my boat marine battery too.....', u'I may order the 4-up model to be able to keep multiple batteries alive at the same time....', u'Living on a farm I have many pieces of equipment that is not used every day and this unit keeps the batteries topped up so when I need the equipment it is ready to go.', u'Also it keeps my second truck charged up during the winter.', u'Of all the battery chargers on the market, the Battery Tender is the best.', u'The device is small and portable, works exceptionally well for maintaining batteries and does not over charge (over charging can decrease the overall life of your battery).', u'It is simple to operate and can be left hooked up to a dormant battery while it is not in use.', u'The Battery Tender can be used while the battery is hooked up to a vehicle/mower/etc.', u'or not.', u'Highly recommended.', u'I comparison shop a lot before buying anything - hopefully you can benefit from my time investment and review.', u'Does the job it says it does.', u'I connected the quick-connect to my battery in my 2004 Honda Civic LX.', u\"I poked the quick-connect through my hood so I don't have to raise my hood every time I want to change the battery.\", u'I pull in the garage (after driving) and connect the battery charger with the quick-connect.', u'I let it charge all the time.', u'I rarely drive; so it helps keep the battery charged.', u'Time will tell, but this battery tender appears to be very well made.', u'The unit is pretty compact and solidly built.', u'I am not a fan of plastic in my garage.', u'It typically indicates to me that the manufacturer is looking to cut costs and maximize profit vs. putting out the highest quality product that they can.', u'This unit has a metal housing.Anyhow, this unit was super easy to set up on my motorcycle and lawnmower.', u'With the leads already installed, I just have to plug it in.', u'The conditioning mode of this tender will go a long ways in increasing the battery life as well.I would certainly recommend this unit!', u'This is the Cadillac of battery chargers.', u'I put my Miata on the charger each winter.', u\"Doesn't overcharge the battery, doesn't dry out the cells, just works perfectly.\", u'It will even charge up a dead battery if you give it a few days.', u\"At this low amperage it isn't ideal for this, but it will work.This is about $50.\", u'A new battery is about $100.', u'Leaving a battery discharging or not charging for a long time (months) kills the battery.', u\"Do the math and you see you can't afford not to have one.\", u'Bought this to keep the battery fully charged when I store my mustang for the winter.', u'Does a great job at keeping it charged and if I ever try to turn the car on it starts up right away.', u'With new cars constantly draining the batteries, I think this is a must if your car sits for more than a week.', u'I have one on my motorcycle, and purchased this one to tend my trailer batteries through the winter.', u'I went onto the Battery tender web site to find out how to hook up batteries in parallel so I can charge the 2 Marine deep cycle batteries that power my trailer.', u'It is working great and looking at the diagrams I will be able to hook up my 2 spare trailer batteries in parallel for a total of 4 deep cycle batteries.', u'This is one of the better battery chargers out there.', u'Why?', u'Because it is temperature compensated.', u'This is important if the battery will be exposed to variations in temperature, either hot or cold.', u'Other brands offer desulfation and remote temperature sensing, which is valuable, but this one can be found cheap, and gives good performance.', u'I got this because my battery kept dying on me.', u'I think I found the source of the problem after I ordered it but this thing will make sure my battery is kept at full charge.', u'It comes with 0-ring terminals and alligator clips.', u'The alligator clips are very easy to put on the terminals.', u'I read somewhere that the 0-rings are for motorcycles and lawn mowers and stuff so I will just keep them for that.', u'Anyways, I used regular jumper cables to give my battery enough juice to start my car.', u'No where in the instructions does it say if the vehicle should be on or off while charging.', u'My best guess was off since it takes almost 2 days for a complete charge and who leaves their car on for that long, and plus you can charge it with the battery out of the car.', u'So anyways, I made that little charge for my battery to get up and running and disconnected the jumper cables.', u'This next part is very important.', u'First you should connect the alligator cables to the quick connect ends on the battery charger.', u'Then put the alligator clips on the car positive/negetive leads.', u'Then if you used an extension cord like I did, plug that into a socket.', u'Now line up the charger end with the extension cord end.', u'Make sure all your connections are well on, and then connect the extension cord to the battery charger.', u'If all goes well, like it did with mine, the red light should come on and say Charging.', u'I read somewhere that if both the green/red lights STAY on, that your battery is completely dead and that you should disconnect the battery right away or it could lead to bad damage.', u'The red/green lights flash at startup but then it turned to red.', u'So anyways, now I am waiting for the complete charge to fill up my battery.', u'It is 3pm now on a Thursday and I will fill in this space with when it completed.', u'Keep in mind the instructions say to keep this charger as far away from the battery as possible while charging.', u'I have mine on the ground right in front of the car so that should work just fine.', u\"I wouldn't recommend putting it inside the engine anywhere like the instructions say.\", u'All in all, for the money of this thing, it is definately worth having around.', u'I wish I knew about this when I had my motorcycle, because that thing died on me every other day and the quick connect on this would have made charging that thing a breeze.', u\"Also with a riding mower that won't start.\", u'I might get a socket end for the cord so it can charge while in the car.', u\"Other people have said this in their reviews and I will see what it's all about.\", u'Good luck charging!Edit:  So the cigarette adapter just makes hooking it up easier, but it still needs to be connected to a DC outlet so I will pass on that.', u'Also, I found out that the unit gets very very hot.', u'I had it on for like 4 hours and touched it and it almost burned me.', u\"Being close to 90 degrees outside couldn't have helped much either, but just be careful.Edit:  So my battery is fully charged now.\", u'It took about a day to charge the whole thing.', u'Not bad for a device of this size to charge a full battery that was dead at once.', u'Very good item, I highly recommend it.', u'This is perfect.', u'It comes with some small alligator clamps and also comes with wires that can be more permanently installed.', u\"It charges and cycles the battery so it won't overcharge.\", u'Cord lengths are long enough and the unit has a nice led system to tell you what it is doing.', u'This is exactly what I needed for my car which sometimes spends a few weeks in the garage without being used.', u'Tired of coming home from business trips to a dead battery that needs to be jumped (then replaced).', u\"I purchased this Battery Tender Plus in July of 2011, it's now March 2014 and it still works flawlessly.I use it in the winter to keep my motorcycle battery topped off.Not much else to say except that this was a wise investment.\", u'Trickle charging with this is the best way to maintain the longevity of your battery.Would recommend to anyone parking a car, truck, or motor home for more than 3-4 weeks.', u'Or anyone parking a motorcycle for over 2-3 weeks.', u'A good handy item to have.', u'I have used it on my motorcycle, lawn motor, 2 scooters and have tender leads on all of these items plus my farm tractor.', u'I also brought a couple of tender leads with the battery clamps, one in my motorcycle and the other is with my farm tractor in case I have a dead battery all I have to do is hook those leads to jumper cable and battery tender leads, am ready to start whatever the jumper cables are hook up to.', u'Make sure that the jumper cable negative and positive are not touching each other I had my Vespa dealership recharge my Piaggio BV250 battery after winter storage.', u'They actually used this battery tender to charge it for me.', u'However, they only sold the Deltran Tender Jr (0.75 Amp).', u'This charger has a faster charging time than the 0.75 Amp.', u'My batteries charge in about 4-6 hours whereas the Jr take about double that (though exact timing obviously depends on how depleted your batteries are).', u\"I've used this charger since then and it's been great.\", u\"It's simple to use: plug it in, connect the clamps or leads to your battery and wait for the green light to light up (indicating a full charge).\", u'There are two sets of connecting cables (one is a clamp and the other a screw on) which is good depending on your need.', u'One benefit of these two cables is that they actually fit into each other and can be used to connect your battery to your bike WHILE your battery is outside of your bike - I had to use this feature because I accidentally shut my seat (lock is battery powered) when the battery was out and had to connect my battery remotely.If you have a Vespa or other scooter, I would highly recommend getting this charger.', u'In cold weather, scooter batteries die in about 3-6 weeks of inactivity.', u'I have several of this model and one with less output but that one is weather/water tight for my boat and jet skis and have been using them for around ten plus years and none have failed yet, other chargers I have bought at auto parts suppliers have never lasted and did not maintain batteries as well it is apparent the batteries are either made better or these charges just maintain them better I am pretty sure it is these chargers.', u\"Great for those batteries that you don't use year round on motorcycles, rvs, lawn mowers, etc.Like it enough to purchase a double one the following year.\", u\"this charger works perfectly and is just what i needed to keep my bmw battery topped off for it doesn't get driven much.\", u'A car we store for the winter in an un-heated garagehas the battery go dead with-in a month .And a couple of times the parasitic drain ruined a cell/battery.So we bought a Battery Tender for that issue.One doesn\\'t need to be versed about an automobileor a BT to use one and solve a variety of problems.It\\'s a worry free ~ wonderful product that completely monitors itself.You can leave it hooked up for weeks or months etc.All though you ought to check on it every once in a while.The cab light in our truck was left on overnight & wouldn\\'t startthe BT restored it enough with-in two hours to turn the motor over.A battery must have at least 3 volts left or the BT won\\'t initiate chargingThen your down to jumping it, if the battery isn\\'t yet ruined.The cords of the Battery Tender Plus are ~Electric cord (box to outlet) 6 ft 2\"longCable that clips to a battery (with clips attached - box to battery) 7 ftGiving a possible continual length of over 13 ft.If that\\'s not long enough, the 25 ft BT extension is economicaland our experience is that the BT is just as effective weather the ex is used or not.Footnote: A warning in the instructions say ~ quote1.', u'\"If the positive battery post is connected to the vehicle chassis,then the vehicle has a positive ground system.2.', u'If the negative battery post is connected to the vehicle chassisthen the vehicle has a negative ground system.', u'(Most systems are negative)3.', u'For negative ground systems connect the positive alligator clip to the positive battery post.4.', u'Then connect the negative alligator clip to the vehicle chassis.', u'\"Then it goes on to state several areas NOT to connect to.This language has always worried me what exactly was the right thing to do here.So I phoned Deltran Corp and asked.They said they have to state that to protect themselves butthat it\\'s fine to hook both clips to the two appropriate terminals of the battery.I must say here that the folks at Deltran are very accessible ~ knowledgeable ~and offered comparison information between the BT Jr verses the BT plus ~ cheerfully.I was impressed with their customer service.', u'I have a 1967 Ford truck that can be quite a drain on the battery at times, especially during the colder months.', u'I purchased this before last winter, and never once had an issue with the battery being too low or too cold, despite some pretty frigid temps.', u'I set this on a shelf just in front of and above my truck, and leave the lead to the charger hanging.', u'I then wired the battery end to my battery and channeled it so the plug end can be pulled through the grill.', u\"It's nearly invisible when it's not in use, but is very quick and easy to plug up.\", u\"I've gotten used to just plugging up the truck every time I'm done with it, and this little puppy brings it up to full charge fairly quickly!Highly recommended, especially if you have an older car that either doesn't get driven much or is a heavy drain on the battery.\", u\"**********************************************************************************Update 01/02/11:Unfortunately, I sold my '67 truck back in the late summer of 2010.\", u'However, this little battery tender was still going strong, so I immediately hooked it up to my 4-wheeler.', u\"It has been doing a great job keeping the battery on it charged up through some especially cold weather we've had.\", u'So after @3years of use, I still give it 5-stars.', u'Awesome product!Update 11/19/12: I noticed something really smelling in my garage, and spent quite a while trying to find it.', u'It was a horrible \"ozone\" like smell, but clearly was the smell of burning electronics.', u'When I got to my Battery Tender, I noticed the light was no longer on and it smelled really bad, so I immediately unplugged it.', u\"I'm not quite sure what happened, but am a little concerned about this.\", u\"That said, I will consider replacing it as I still believe it's a good product.Update 02/19/13: As these units carry a 10-year limited warranty (if you have your receipt), I decided to send it in.\", u'The cost of mailing it was around $9 for standard post, and $11 for Priority Mail.', u'The warranty replacement charge is $12.95 (why not just $13?).', u'So in total, it will cost me just under $25.', u'That is, assuming they replace it, which I certainly hope they will!', u'I will post follow-up later.Update 03/20/13: It took approximately 2 weeks, but Deltran DID replace my charger under warranty.', u'The thing is, the replacement charger - which appears to be brand new, and not refurbished - did not come with ANY paperwork.', u'No \"we\\'re sorry for your inconvenience\" letter, no receipt, no packing slip... nothing.', u'So my warranty on the replacement will only be as good as the remainder of what I had left on my original 10 years (approx 4 years).', u'The inconvenience of the return was frustrating, and I\\'d have liked at least an acknowledgement of that from Deltran, but it \"is what it is\".', u'Hopefully this new one holds up at least as long as the first.', u'I have been using a Battery Tender Junior for about 5 years on my motorcycle.', u'I always plug in the bike and it works great.I recently purchased the Battery Tender Plus to use on my Duramax truck (2 batteries).', u'It seems to work great so far.', u'I expect long life of the unit and the batteries just as I have in the past using this line of Battery Tenders.I give it 4 instead of 5 stars only because of the short length of cable they give you.', u\"The Junior's cables are so long that I can run that thing clear across the room.\", u\"The Plus' cables are so short that I had to splice in more cable.\", u\"They apparently don't expect you to charge your batteries in-vehicle with the Plus.By the way, the Plus brings my 2 very large batteries in my truck upto full charge in less than 8 hours.\", u\"They are new batteries and the truck's charging system works just fine and the truck is even driven almost everyday.\", u'However, there is alot of parasitic draw on the batteries with the remote start / alarm system on overnite.', u'Combined with the 100 plus degree heat of the desert, the Battery Tender Plus is warranted.Of course I would not expect it to recharge my truck batteries if they were dead.', u'It is not designed to.', u'Make sure you look at the specs and know what you need.', u'I just needed a battery tender - something that would keep my batteries at full charge or restore the bit of charge lost overnite from the parasitic draw of the car alarm / starter.', u'By spec, the Battery Tender Plus cannot recharge these large batteries from dead.', u'Again, know what you need.', u'The tech folks at Deltran can help you with that.', u'Had a bit of bad luck with my first unit I ordered.', u\"the charger would not enter its 'float' mode where it maintains charge from 100-103%.\", u\"amazon replaced no problem (love amazon's returns!\", u'no hassle) and got one that worked great.', u'I love this thing.', u'In the winter It gets quite cold where I live and I have 2 cars.', u\"Sometimes I don't run 1 for maybe a week or more at a time, so while it sits I throw the charger on it.\", u'When I go to drive, disconnect cords, and she roars to life.', u'When I first got this I was using to charge a battery that had completely died.', u'It charged the battery in about 24 hours, the battery was a full size 12v car battery.', u'I believe the manual said it should have taken around 18 hours.', u'Either way, for getting a battery maintaining and charging device for this price I have been very happy with the product.', u'These come with 2 types of cords, one is just the alligator clips and the other you can use to actually put under the screw that holds the battery cables in place to the battery.', u'I have the more permanent one on my car and just use the alligator clips for my truck.', u'If you really like the permanent ones you can order and extra set of them, I think they cost 5-6$.', u'Overall very happy with product and would buy again if I needed another charger.', u\"I've had my Battery Tender Plus for 10 years, it has bounced off the concrete garage floor a number of times and still works fine.\", u'It has really extended the life of my motorcycle batteries.', u'I leave it plugged in all of the time, it will not overcharge or boil a battery.', u'Excellent product.', u'I got this to plug in to my lawn mower a few weeks till spring to make sure the battery had a good charge, since I had to use a motorcycle to jump it earlier in the winter, to see if it worked after I bought it (came with the house).', u'This Battery Tender did the job.', u'I plugged it in for a few weeks, and then when it came time to start up the mower, it had no issues.The small size of the unit is a plus, as it is easy to store when not in use.', u\"I'm one of the klutzy people who really can't manage technology, but I bought this one because my friend suggested it.\", u'I loved how easy this charger was to use, and it came with very easy to follow instructions.', u\"It's a really top notch product, and I recommend it to all my car-savvy chicks.\", u'I doubt this thing needs another 5-star review on top of the thousand it already has but just to chime in, this product is great: simple, easy to setup and understand and comes with more parts and connectors than you probably need.I have this paired with an Odyssey battery (B0000BYEXOand it was no trouble, straight out of the box.', u'Plugged it in, attached it with clips (there are other options here, but the clips seemed easiest) and it started charging.', u'I checked back a bit later and it was in \"Storage\" mode and nothing exploded so all happy on that front.I was surprised that something this small and inexpensive could be such a nice battery charger and tender.', u'I have one permanently connected on my mini-motorhome.', u'It works great while connected to AC power AND the engine is running.', u\"Whenever I'm hooked up to AC power, the battery is maintained when powered up and not damaged when the engine is running.\", u\"I'd surely call this a must have for RV's.\", u'Have a Junior for my Toro Zero Turn lawn mower and two tender plusses for my Fiat Abarth and Benz AMG...they are easy to install and work great.....you can not go wrong with this product.', u'No complain, is working right and perfect.', u'4 stars cause it should bring a switch to turn on and off and the clam to connect to battery is week it should be stronger .I will update .', u\"let's see how long last, I never have one.\", u'I have a 2000 Mustang GT convertible that I keep garaged and drive on nice,sunny days.', u'I had been using a cheap trickle charger from Harbor Freight.', u'Recently I discovered the battery had died so I decided it was time for a &#34;real&#34; charger.', u'The reviews were great so I decided to give it a try.', u'It is a small but powerful unit.', u'It took  my battery from stone dead  to a full charge within 24 hours and it automatically maintains a full charge.', u'It uses LED lights to let you know the status of your battery.', u'I wish it had a gauge instead of the lights but I still would highly recommend this to friends and family.', u'After owning this for only a short duration, this seems to be the ticket to a longer lasting battery.', u'For a vehicle that sits more that it is driven this is certainly cheaper than the headache of a dead, and possibly damaged battery.', u'Very small size with nice build quality and cables.', u'I now have 5 Battery Tender Plus chargers.', u'Ever since I started keeping my little used batteries on a Battery Tender, I have not had a battery failure.When I first bought my Generator (over 15 years ago) the starter batteries would only last a couple years because the Generator was used so infrequently, sometimes not for a couple years.', u'Since then, I now leave a Battery Tender connected and also start the Generator once a year.', u\"The current battery in my Generator has now been in for almost 10 years!I had to replace the battery recently (2 years ago) in my Polaris 800 ATV because it kept going dead (after couple months) because I didn't keep it on a charger (it sits in a shed with no electricity).\", u\"I didn't think it would be a problem because I use the ATV 4-5 times a year.\", u'But modern AGM and Freedom Batteries cannot tolerate repeated deep discharges.', u'I knew better but was too lazy to keep pulling the battery out or running a very long extension cord to the shed.', u'Now I remove the battery and keep it connected to a Battery Tender.I could site many more instances where I am now getting triple or even greater life from equipment or vehicle batteries by keeping them connected to a Battery Tender Plus.', u'Given that even a small ATV battery costs upwards of $60, the cost of a Battery Tender will pay for itself in a few years.And Battery Tenders have a 10 year warranty, unheard of for any battery charger.', u\"It works, and that's all that matters.\", u'Returning from overseas, I got home and went straight to the garage to fire up my Harley.', u'The battery tender showed a good charge.', u'I disconnected it and she started right up.', u'I have used this for years on my motorcycle battery.', u'The adapters are included , so I leave it hooked up to my battery and run the wire under the seat.', u\"When I'm ready to hook it up , all i have to do is plug it in .This one i bought for my mother to use when her car sits idle for a few months every year while she travels.\", u'I have used Battery Tender products for some years so had high expectations of the Battery Tender Plus.', u'I use it to keep my truck and ATV batteries in tip top condition as they are not used regularly and have had a tendency to go flat.', u'The charger makes light work of recharging and when in maintenance mode keeps the batteries fully charged.', u'Electrical consumption while maintaining charge is very light.', u'The day before I was to leave on a trip I found the battery was dead in my car.', u\"I don't drive this particular one often so I knew I could jump it but sometimes when they are that low driving it doesn't bring it back up enough.\", u'So I checked Amazon for this charger and they just happened to have it local so I got it that day - awesome luck!', u'Charged it over night and the next day we were off.', u\"It didn't get to a full charge so when we got back I put it back on until the green light came on.\", u'Then I stuck it on the other car.', u'I plan to use this once a week on both cars.', u'The size of this charger is so convenient I will take it with me just in case.', u'Never lost a battery to winter low temperatures/forgetting to charge it since I got this.', u\"I peer thru a garage door window occasionally to check that it's little LED light is green, and that's it.\", u\"I chose this brand because it doesn't drain your battery if the power goes off.\", u\"We have power outages here from time to time, and our old wiring has had some bad connections show up in our house's history, so I didn't want that worry.Chose the Plus model because I'm using it on a size 27 or 29 (can't recall which) deep cycle battery.\", u'It took a long while charging when the battery was 50% discharged, but it does do it - no need to fast charge the battery first with another charger.', u'Works very well, good for the bike, car or boat.', u'The unit does tend to get a bit warm whne in use.', u'I was tired of my RV batteries not correctly maintaining charge.', u'Had used other \"Bargain Brand\" chargers with poor results.', u'Seems to be working fine.', u'I use it to maintain two 6 volt batteries wired in series.', u'I am monitoring the price of this item and plan to buy another if and when the price drops.', u'(Easy to do if you leave one in your Amazon Cart.Steve I bought a battery tender Jr & the BIG ONE,for cold weather in Pa.Cant really tell the difference,suggest the Jr unless you have specific needs.', u'We have a 2006 MDX which is rarely driven....its a family car.', u'That fact alone means that the battery wont have enough juice to start the car when we need it.', u'The TENDER not only charged this battery, but kept it under control so that the car started perfect when we needed it.', u'This is a must have product for your garage.', u'Battery Tender Plus - supports my 2-Bank system & allows me to keep charged all batteries...definitely recommend to others.', u'Would buy again & again & again.', u'Great price & fast shipping.', u'Purchased this to maintain the battery in one of my vehicles that sits over the winter.Shipped extremely fast (received next day) and just got done hooking it up.', u\"I remove the battery from my vehicle because I didn't have any outlets near the car and I didn't want to run an extension cord because I am sure someone would trip on it or unplug it.This unit came with 2 cords to attach to the battery (via alligator clips or ring terminals).\", u'I ended up using the alligator clips and everything worked out just fine.I then plugged the unit into the wall and the red light came on which means that the battery needed to be charged.', u\"It's been on for about an hour now, but that's ok with me because I purchased this thing to maintain the battery, not to rapidly charge it.I do like the fact that the manufacturer offers a 10 year warranty for this item, however it clearly states in the manual that you need to send $15.95 with the unit for evaluation, shipping & handling.\", u'Then the warranty card states that if any repairs need to be made, the company will notify you of the cost.', u'Sounds like some sort of a screwy scam to me, but if this unit ever fails (hopefully in many years to come) I will simply purchase another one because I am sure it would cost you about $5-10 to ship the unit back to the manufacturer, then you need to include your $16 fee and then pay for any repairs.', u'The darn thing only costs $40...why would you pay and waste your time trying to collect on the warranty?All in all, I like this thing and as long as it works for many years I will be happy.', u\"***UPDATE 2/18***I ended up putting the battery back in the car and running a HD extension cord.I've checked the battery every few days with a volt meter and it is holding constant at about 13.27 volts.Still happy with my purchase.\", u'Fairly new battery from autozone.', u'Brand new, it measured14v.', u'Left the cabin light/3rd stop light on overnight by accident and battery was down to 12.7v.', u\"Still good enough, but my alternator wasn't taking the battery back to 14v.\", u'Tried this tender for about 12 hours.', u'Voltage is better.', u'It works.', u'This is an excellent way to keep your battery topped up all year round, with the very slow charging rate and safety cut outs your battery will always be in tip top shape.', u'i have two, one on each of my bikes and i think they were a great buy.', u'This is a nice little compact charger that I like so much that I got the accessory plug-in battery hookups so I could use it without the clamps on my pickup and motorcycles.', u'Purchased the battery tender to maintain a full, healthy charge on my vehicle and generator batteries.', u\"My vehicles and generator don't get used very often, so i'm really hoping this product extends the life and performance of my batteries.\", u\"Since it has arrived, I've been very impressed with it's performance.\", u\"This product is much smaller and safer than any other charger/tender I've yet to come across.\", u'Keep in mind that this is a trickle charger, charging only 1.25amps per hour, so it does take some time to properly charge a battery.', u'As the instructions annotate, it will NOT charge a totally dead battery (for safety reasons).', u'This is defined as a battery with 3V or less charge, per the manual.', u'It goes on to explain that when this is the case, the battery is likely defective and needs to be tested/replaced.', u'Overall, very happy with this purchase.', u\"Only thing that could've made me happier would be if it was made in America.\", u'I use this to keep the battery charged on my motorcycle during the off season.', u'No problems or complaints whatsoever.']\n"

      "[u'This is a pretty decent little tire gauge.', u\"For the price, it's a great little tire gauge.The Good:- I think mine is pretty accurate.\", u\"I've compared it to 3 other gauges and it's within 2 PSI of them.\", u\"It's also pretty consistent with readings, which is a good thing.- There is only one button, which makes it easy to use with gloves on.\", u'This is very nice in the wintertime!- The little light throws just enough illumination to find the valve stem in the dark, which is nice.- It can measure in PSI, KPa, Bar, and Kgf/cm2.', u\"Which must be nice if you're .... Swedish?The Bad:- It's not the easiest to seal onto the valve stem to get a good reading.\", u'You sort of have to press and wiggle.- Batteries are difficult or impossible to replace.', u\"There is no little battery door - you'll have to take the thing apart to see about new batteries.- My clumsy hands frequently bump the button.\", u\"This changes the unit of measurement to KPa, which I don't know how to read.I like this thing, and I'm sure it'll give me years of usage, as long as I can figure out how to take the thing apart and change the batteries.\", u'It would be a five star product if changing the batteries was easier.', u\"I'm crazy about the MPG, so I love to use this and make sure my tires are at their optimal PSI for &#62;55mpg at all times.\", u\"It's a simple device, but it works great!\", u\"I don't check my tire pressure often and so I don't know how this may hold up over time but it seems to be pretty accurate and convenient.\", u'Great price and nice looking.', u'The tire gauge works really well.', u'The readings are consistent.', u\"It's come in really handy especially now during the winter.\", u\"This is he first tire gauge that I've owned that doesn't allow air to leak out of my tires while checking the pressure.\", u\"Surprisingly, all of the other ones that I've purchased were more expensive than this one, yet they all give inaccurate readings.\", u'In addition, the prior ones end up leaking out more air than I put in.', u'I use my own air compressor, which is only capable of slowly adding air to tires.', u'When I use my old tire gauges they let out more air than I can add back in.', u\"It's a pleasure to finally find such a simple gauge that actually works.\", u'These work okay for the price.', u\"They don't compare to my craftsman ones that I use for personal use, but they work just fine for work since I could care less if they break or if someone borrows them.\", u'Did sorta break one where I have to take the battery out from time to time to reset it, other than that, works as advertised.', u'This gauge works easily and quite well.', u'It remembers the pressure until you turn it off.', u'Very enjoyable irreverent Opera book.', u'The tire gauge works great and is very fast.', u\"It shows your pressure in 4 different measurements in case you're super nerdy like that.\", u'It has an illuminated LED front, so you can find the valve stem at night with ease.', u'The back-light LCD is easy to read.', u'I had zero issue with air leaks and no difficulty seating it firmly on the valve stem to get a reading without wasting a bunch of air.', u'Measures in half PSI increments and displays the previous reading for 30 seconds before the tool auto-offs.It seems very accurate and is super easy to use.', u'Has an internal battery from the factory, so is ready to work out of the box.', u'This works well.', u'It is simple one button use and the light is bright enough to check tires in low light areas.', u'Accurate, easy to use, and well-lit tire gauge.', u'It has a non-slip surface and comes with batteries.', u'I like the look and feel of this quality item.', u'Highly recommend.', u'I like it!', u'Seems to work fine and numbers are consistent.', u'I like that it displays different measurements of pressure (psi, bar, etc).', u\"I live in Europe so all the gas stations don't measure in PSI.\", u'This device has all the different measurements at the press of a button.', u'Light is useful to in low visibility!', u\"Its also the coolest looking air pressure gauge I've ever owned!\", u\"I'm one of those that check tire pressure once a week so having a good tire gauge is imperative.\", u'For the past year I have used several different digital and mechanical gauges.', u'I had issues with all of them.', u\"Few of the mechanical one's did not work well in extreme cold weather, also hard to use with gloves on and too cold to use with bare hands.\", u'Few others had issues with sealing the valve so it would not read accurately.', u'Some of the other digital brands did not seal the valve, or the battery would die quickly (like every week), or it was reading inaccurately.', u\"I've been researching for the past few weeks on Amazon and this was the only one with great praise so i decided to try it out.\", u'As soon as i got it i ran out and compared it to a mechanical one which I have been using with frustration and also a friend of mines gauge (Commercial grade digital gauge) and low and behold this one read accurately to 35 lbs, w/o issues and the mechanical one I had took me about a minute to get a correct seal to get a reading and then it read 3lbs too high, 5 lbs too low, etc.', u'Compared to the commercial grade gauge.', u'This gauge is simple to read, easy to get a seal w/o much pressure to the valve and comfortable to hold glove or not.', u'So clean out your gauge drawer like i did and replace it with this one.', u'This is a must have tool to have.', u'I would recommend having this tool in your car at all times.', u'I was looking for digital gauges for some time.', u'There are definitely many choices and price points.', u'This is an economy priced gauge that works perfectly for me.', u'While a pencil type gauge is simple and reliable, it is difficult to see and not as convenient, especially in poor lighting conditions.Updated 3/25/14After using it for some time I can only confirm that this gauge is perfect for its intended purpose.', u'No reason to look for a more expensive alternative It is very light and feels cheap.', u'I wish there was a way to turn the light off to save battery life, and I wish it took a standard battery instead of button cells.', u'Having a little more weight to it would make it feel more durable.', u'Not sure yet how long the batteries will last.', u'I hope a while, because you have to use a screwdriver and take it apart to change them.', u'Not bad for the price, though.', u\"This tire gauge seems to be very accurate and is nice to use when you don't have light and you need to check your tire pressure.\", u'I love the feel of it how to can switch what measurement type to what you need.', u'I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.', u'This is my first digital tire gauge.', u'So far so good the light on the head of the nozzle is very useful when it is dark and you need to get a reading.', u'The non-slip makes it real easy to hold and it is an awesome price!', u'I use this gauge on our three cars every two weeks.', u'It is east to use and sure beats the old pencil type gauge.', u'The gauge is smalland can fit almost anywhere in your car and it is very precise!', u\"I use this gauge for checking pressure in my car's tires to insure the pressure is balanced.\", u'The gauge is easy to use.', u'The reason for four stars is that the accuracy is only 0.5 psi due to the decimal digit only displaying the number 0 or 5.', u'I could estimate the pressure more accurately on my analog tire gauge that had a pointer like the second hand on a clock.', u'But after many years of use the analog gauge broke and I decided to try a digital gauge.', u'For ease of use I prefer this digital gauge with the light.', u'For accuracy I prefer the analog gauge.', u'I purchased this digital gauge because the new tires on my Jeep are 80 PSI, and my old mechanical gauge only went up to 50.', u'I am very pleased with this unit.', u\"It's fast and accurate.\", u'The fact that it displays tenths of a pound is actually more useful than I initially thought it would be.~Rusty Spoons The only thing I do not like is it is easy to turn on when something else skims across the button while i storage, such as in a glove box.', u'I think the on/off button needs some kind of recess or covering so one must intentionally press the button to turn it on.', u'At least it turns itself off also after a short period of time.Its accuracy compares well to my high quality, air pressure measuring devices in the 35 - 45 PSI pound range.', u'Easy to use.', u'The light makes it much easier to read than other digital gauges.', u'The pressure readings agree exactly with my other digital gauge.', u'I bought a second one for my Wife.', u'This inexpensive air gauge is the best one I have used.', u'I get a consistently tight seal and quick/accurate reading.', u'I have been buying small items to put on a key chain set up.', u'This has a hole in the handle so it looked like it might work but it is about 5 inches long and much bigger than reasonable for a key chain tire gauge.', u'However it is a great tire gauge.', u\"The features I like best are that both the display is backlit and there is a blue led light that is not particularly bright but bright enough to do it's job that shines on the tire valve so it is easy to use at night time.\", u'It is also digital of course and takes readings not just in PSI but also BAR, KPA, Kg/cm so that adds some versatility to the unit as well.', u'It also can read up to 100 PSI which will cover a wide range of vehicles beyond just passenger car tires should you need that.', u'It is very lightweight being made of plastic but appears like it will be pretty sturdy.', u'I think it is a good value, a reasonable price for what you get and will keep it in my main cars glove box.', u'I might get more after I have had it longer.', u'Tire pressure gauges at gas stations can be very inaccurate if working at all so having this with you will cover you tire pressure readings day and night, would be good for a motorcycle too.', u'So far no complaints at all.', u\"I've compared the Tekton's readings to a standard gauge and they were the same.\", u'The light has been nice to have when checking tires without having the best ambient light.', u'Works as intended displays accurately and is backlit Simple to operate.', u'Easy to read display.', u'Seems to be reasonably accurate.', u'Easy to hold and operate.', u'Overall, a really nice pressure gage.']\n"

      "[u'I was given a sample Roll of 3Ms Wrap and Repair Silicone Tape (1in x 2 yd) to test and evaluate.', u'I repaired a leaking water hose, a leaking kitchen gasket before calling the plumber.', u'I taped the handle of my shovel that was giving me wood splinters, and taped my finger for a day for good measure.', u'I was very happy with all results.', u'No residue or wear was left on my finger.Silicon is a remarkable substance.', u'Wikipedia notes that silicon provides minimal heat conduction, toxicity and chemical reactivity.', u'It repels water and can form watertight seals.', u'It is resistant to oxygen, ozone, ultraviolet light and microbial growth.', u'It is stable over a wide range of temperatures.', u'It can be used as electrical insulation and has some fire protection properties.', u'It is highly gas permeable.', u'It sticks to glass.', u'This product sticks to itself when tightly stretched.What this means to me is that I can:* Carefully, and not too tightly, temporarily wrap it directly around a wound on my body or repair a medical cast being careful not to cut off circulation.', u'* Repair glazing seals since silicon sticks well to glass* Repair gaskets, hoses and leaking pipes around my car, lawn irrigation, pool and general plumbing whether outdoors or indoors.', u'Whether I decide it to be a semi-permanent or temporary fix will depend on how lucky I feel.', u'* Use it when I am missing electrical tape* Repair a broken wooden handle on my hammer, shovel, frying pan or anywhere else a more comfortable grip is needed.The packaging label reads:\"Repair hose, tool, pipe or electrical surfaces with this super stretchy, highly conformable, adhesive-free tape that fuses strongly to itself and can withstand extreme temperatures -85F to 500F.', u'Designed to be heat, friction, and UV resistant, this versatile tape meets UL 510 standards and can be used for automotive, marine, home and recreational repairs.Directions:1.', u'Prepare and clean the surface to be wrapped.2.', u'Peel back the liner and wrap the necessary amount of tape around the repair surface stretching the tape and overlapping by half the width.3.', u'One the surface is wrapped, overlap the last wrap fully to ensure a good seal.', u'\"Living in the desert where blown automobile hoses are not uncommon in summer, I want a roll of this in each of my family\\'s cars for unexpected emergencies!', u'I am putting a roll near the medicine cabinets and in every toolbox.', u'I recommend this product.I was given a sample to test and evaluate; I do my best to provide a review that is fair, honest and thorough.', u'I hope this is helpful.', u'I first saw this tape demonstrated at a local boat show.', u'I watched the demonstrator wrap the tape around a corrugated pipe.', u'In conformed perfectly to the contours.', u'Another pipe had a leaky joint.', u'This tape was wrapped around the joint.', u'The leak was stopped instantly.', u'Even wilder, the demonstrator wrapped some tape around my finger.', u'It adhered to itself, yet came off cleanly.', u'She did the same to my wife (same piece of tape) with the same result.This tape uses no adhesive at all.', u'It sticks to itself and somehow forms a tight bond with the surface you wrap with it.', u\"Over time, the tape's bond to itself becomes permanent.\", u'The repairs it makes are good for some time.', u'I keep a roll of this in my RV.', u'It is heatproof so it can repair a hot water pipe, a garden hose, or anything else you can wrap.', u\"It's good to 500 degrees F so it can be used in applications where other materials will fail.The wrap is also very good for wrapping tool handles.\", u'It makes a nice &#34;grippy&#34; surface.', u'This is one little roll that will always be in my tool box.', u\"At this time, I don't have much that needs repairing, but I tried this out on a surge protector whose cord became frayed, exposing the wires within.\", u'Never having used a non-adhesive product before, I was a bit baffled that this was not at all sticky.', u'How can something that isn\\'t sticky stick?As the product description says, \"allow the silicone to fuse to itself,\" after which it forms \"a permanent, air and water tight seal.\"', u\"It worked well for what I used it for, but I can't say how it would work on a leaky pipe.\", u'It seems sturdy, though, and it sticks without being sticky.', u\"If you've never had a hose or pipe spring a leak at the most inconvenient moment, whether in your house or car, you are lucky - and probably living on borrowed time.\", u'Also, relying exclusively on duct tape to handle whatever catastrophe is on your handyperson horizon, may doom your future repair.This product, when applied properly, eliminates the &#34;struggle factor&#34; involved when attempting to wrap and seal a leak.', u\"That's a significant advantage when you're in &#34;emergency&#34; mode.\", u'Upon application, it requires that you (moderately) stretch this ribbon of silicone, which makes both sides attach themselves to each other and also allows adequate pressure at the leak to seal it.', u'Since silicone reacts with virtually nothing, it tends to hold its shape and make the fix semi-permanent.For increased longevity, or when attempting to block a stream of hot automotive coolant, duct tape adhesive may very likely let you down.', u\"The pressure that this tape applies is superior to duct tape, which isn't elastic, and therefore doesn't maintain compression on the puncture/crack/gap, allowing fluid to gradually saturate the adhesive and work its way out.Be aware that one thing this product can't do is seal a leaky pipe as it butts up against a flange.\", u'A surface angled at 90 degrees will not provide an adequate area to allow a proper &#34;wrap&#34;.Get some, before your next MacGyver street cred.', u'challenge.', u'That is some kind of temperature range for this product...', u'Normally a limited temp range is what makes any \"tape\"  with adhesives fail over time.', u'That and something desolving the adhesive.This basic silicone is pretty tough also, more durable than any tape product I can think of off hand.You just need to be sure you wrap this properly and on a clean surface with the final wrap fully over top of the one before.Could be a five star product if it does as advertised and is actually \"permanent\" repair.Will need to be tested over time to know for sure,  but test wraps here so far shows it\\'s easy to use and  really grips to itself well.I\\'m thinking this might make very good cover for electrical wire connections instead of plastic electrical tape that has short life span in use.', u'Might be as good as heat shrink tube if you can pull it tight enough to seal.', u\"Will be trying many applications with this.Over a dollar a foot, but might just pay for itself many times over when really needed in bad situation This is a tape that's strictly for wrapping around something.\", u'It sticks to itself but not to other surfaces, so it is quite specialized.', u'When you need to wrap around some fairly narrow pipe or wire, it should perform well.', u\"Don't bother trying to wrap packages or anything like that because it won't adhere.You'll want to store it in the package or at least with the label since it has unique applications.\", u\"The weather's been too moderate to say whether it stands up to temperature extremes (it claims to), but in mild weather, it does the trick!\", u'Used it to repair a garden hose chewed by our dog in several places.', u\"I didn't want to mess with a bunch of hose repair kits (and they always leak anyway), so this was a handy fix.\", u\"My son's radiator hose in his car sprung a leak, and he didn't know what to do.\", u'He asked me to give him a ride to the parts store so he could buy another hose.', u'I was in the middle of something, and I told him to see if this tape would hold it long enough to get him to the part store.', u\"He used the tape, and said that it didn't leak at all.\", u'the whole way to the parts store, which is about a 2 mile drive from my house.', u'So even when the engine of the car got warm, this tape stayed strong and stayed together without any leak.', u'I highly recommend this product.', u'Quite frankly every junk drawer, glovebox and first aid kit should have a roll of silicone tape in it.', u'Better than duct tape since it conforms to the item it is repairing, it is water proof, heat resistant and will hold indefinitely.', u'It is easy to use and will not get away from you.', u'The uses are endless as are the benefits.', u'Better to be prepared than sorry.', u'This is a great product to have in your car and in your toolbox for emergency repairs.', u'What other product can you confidently use at extreme temperatures without having to resort to some sort of messy adhesive and primer?Just a couple of caveats:  Be sure to really stretch the tape as you apply it; it feels counterintuitive, but it\\'s necessary for \"activating\" the tape to be able to stick to itself.', u'Pull tight!', u'And also be sure that you end by wrapping a complete layer of the tape upon itself.', u\"If you are trying to repair something that you don't have good access to, you might skimp on one of these two points and end up having a leak.\", u'Otherwise, use it on anything and everything!My only complaint would be that I wish the roll was longer.', u\"It's six feet (which will then stretch to twelve feet), but you'll go through it fast.\", u'My dog likes to chew the garden hose and put little holes in it.', u'I keep buying new ones.', u'It is nice to have a repair product that I can quickly wrap around the pinholes, and it adheres nicely to stop the leaks from spraying all over me when I turn on the hose.', u\"This is a huge improvement compared to wrapping Teflon tape around something, because Teflon tape won't hold much pressure at all.\", u'I used this awhile back to repair a leak under the kitchen sink.', u\"That was maybe 6 months ago, and I've never had a problem with it since.\", u'Now I used this stuff to do my other sinks.', u'Goes on easy.', u\"You can put it on wet pipes too, but it's easier if you dry them off a little first.\", u'I also usually cut what I need off the roll first.', u'It can be a little awkward to get on, either off the roll or with a cut piece.', u'But it does the job.', u'Definitely will always keep a roll of this handy.', u'I like this tape for a few reasons.', u\"First of all:  Is it really tape if it doesn't have an adhesive?\", u\"I'll go along for now.The rubber grip on my axe handle was cracking so I removed it and replaced it with this tape.\", u'I liked the fact that the tape is self-adhesive and is easy to apply.', u'Once applied, the handle offers an excellent grip with way more traction than bare wood or fiberglass.I can imagine all kinds of alternative uses for this tape.', u\"I'm ordering more so I have some on-hand for a leaky pipe or similar.\", u'Used this 3M Wrap and Repair Silicone Tape on a small leak that sprung on a hose carrying my power steering fluid.', u'Stopped the leak completely and power steering has worked fine in the two weeks since.', u\"I don't look at it as a permanent fix and I'll be replacing the hose hopefully in the next few weeks, but if you're in a pinch I see no reason not to recommend this product.\", u'Seems like it would work well for household use as well.', u'This  tape can be used for sealing and grip enhancements.', u'No tool kit should be without it.I have used this tape for all sorts of fixes around the house..', u'I sealed a leak under my bathroom sink.', u'I wrapped my bicycle handle and tennis racket for improved grip.', u'I tidied a few hoses the engine bay in my sports car (loose tape).The tape is self-fusing and adheres to whatever you wrap it around simply by friction.', u'And because it provides a watertight seal, it will never come loose or slide off (so long as you wrap it tight enough).A very versatile product.', u'Highly recommended!', u'This tape is a convenient way to bond certain items when an adhesive tape is not necessary.', u'The roll is 1 inch by 2 yards, which is plenty for household projects.The trick to using this is to ensure a tight wrap.', u\"Otherwise it won't stop a leak or hold a broken handle together.\", u'I have a drip sprinkler system that hooks directly into my outside water line, and I constantly have a major leak at that connection.', u\"I've tried all sorts of different tapes and glues, and while they all seemed to work at first, within a week or so they all failed.\", u'So I was very glad to try this one.', u'The good news is that it works better than the others.', u\"But it doesn't get 5 stars.\", u'Why not?', u'It still leaks.', u\"It's a small dripping leak, but it isn't foolproof.\", u\"So it's very good, but not great.\", u'The 3M Wrap and Repair Silicone Tape is amazing stuff.', u'I ordered it to try and fix the rubber tubes inside my Cuissinart 1100 coffee maker.', u'They had begun to leak from cracking at the point of attachment to the metal tubes.', u'I applied the silicone tape as directed and it adhered to the rubber tubes to the point where I could not pull it off without destroying the tubes.', u'Unfortunately the leaking had already caused some other electrical problems and I could not determine the longevity of the tape.', u'In trying to remove the tape, I feel it is there for good.The tape is about the thickness of 3-4 file cards.', u'It is 1 inch wide and 6 feet long.', u'It has no adhesive or sticky substance which can be felt.', u'When it is stretched around something, it just sticks to the object and to itself.', u'There is some clear plastic which it does not stick to between the layers of tape on the roll.', u\"It was very easy to work with and at some point I hope to try it on a slightly leaky pipe in my son's house on our next visit to see him.\", u\"I'll add more here if it doesn't work on the water pipe.\", u'At this point I highly recommend this product.', u\"I've been using various types of self-adhering silicone tape for various household tasks.\", u'They work great in some applications; not so well in others.', u'I have yet to achieve a leak-free garden hose repair.', u\"Dirt on the hose and some that inevitably gets between the tape layers stops it from sealing properly...even if it's sealed at first, the water eventually seems to work it's way through as the hose is flexed.\", u\"On the other hand, I've used it to attach a shop-vac hose to my miter saw and it works perfectly to hold everything together.The big advantage of the 3M version is that it's translucent.\", u\"Unlike the other silicone tape that I've purchased from Amazon, the underlying color shows through.\", u'Otherwise, it seems to be pretty much the same as the other versions.']\n"

Love them.', u'I also took pictures of my Fog lights with the original bulb at night right after I installed them with the bulbs they came with, and then I took picture, same place at night, after I replace the bulbs with the Philips CrystalVision Ulta, no doubt brighter, whiter, more penetrating straight ahead and as good or better side illumination.', u'Better all around plus long lasting, what more could you ask for.Although I have had them for almost two years I admit I hardly use them, may be a few hours of use.', u'However I am glad to have them now.', u'Although we have FOG today after a cold front that made national news, it is not typically foggy here, but I just moved into a neighborhood that has a labyrinth of turns that are not well lighted.', u'I now use the fog lights to illuminate the corners and turns.', u\"Love it.NOW MY RECOMMENDATION:- Stick with NAME BRAND, Like Philips.- Stick with standard Watts, aka 55 watts for an H7.- Don't go for SUPER bright higher watt lights, they burn out faster and are illegal!\", u'!- You are NOT an off road vehicle and there are laws that limit how bright road vehicle lights can be.- Repeat higher watt lights or ones claiming to be way more powerful WILL BURN OUT VERY FAST!', u\"!- No matter how bright your FOG light are, YOU CAN'T SEE THROUGH FOG.- Fog lights are more for others to see you than you to drive like an idiot in limited visibility.- DON'T SPEND more than $10 to $12 or so per bulb; bulbs costing $20 or more are a waste of money.- LAST forget BLUE TINT, trying to look like FAKE High-intensity discharge lamps (HID lamps), that is silly.Bottom line recommend these, they have proven to be long lasting and useful.\", u'These are a good value and mail order saves a bunch over the Auto Part stores that charge way too much.', u'My budget was to spend less the least amount while getting premium quality.', u'I think these fit that bill.', u'Ok, one of my headlight bulb gave up after about 6 years of use (from brand new car).I got this set hoping to get a more Xenon like light.It took me a little bit of fiddling to install it but it was due to my own clumsiness.Once the one replaced (I left the other one installed), I do not see much difference in color or power.', u'One thing I am not sure about is if there was a way to install it that would prevent me from putting it wrongly.', u'It seems ok but there is a kind of rainbow effect (on the upper edge of the beam) resulting from it.I did not get anyone flashing me as if my lights were bothering anyone so I guess that should be alright but I cannot help wondering if I did it right.', u'The bulb colour is approximately the advertised 4000K.', u\"It's certainly not that bright HID white; you'll want to go to the Diamondvision 5000K bulbs for that.\", u'Still, if you want a nice, natural 4000K bulb, this is a good buy.', u\"The price is right, and they haven't failed in the 2 months I've had them.\", u\"Hardly an indication of how long it'll last, but it ought to be better than the Sylvania's.\", u'I feel like the throw has increased when I drive at night, and can now clearly see where the left beam is shorter than the right beam (as it should be).', u'For anybody wondering, the bulbs have a slight blue tint to them.', u\"UPDATE:  While I'm pleased with the light output of Philips H7 Crystalvision bulbs, after 11 months, both bulbs blew.\", u'I was vacationing in Maine at the time, so I picked up a pair of standard halogens ($15 each bulb with my \"Massachusetts discount\") and installed them, so I\\'d have something other than my fog and running lights for night driving, but the standard halogens appear dim to me.', u\"I ordered a replacement pack of the Philips Crystalvisions and will install them as soon as they arrive in the mail.I cheaped out on the build of my Porsche Cayenne and didn't spring an additional $1850 for Bi-Xenon headlights, something I regret as I've had HID headlights installed on other vehicles and, although oncoming vehicles may not appreciate the blinding white light they throw, I feel more secure driving at night with them as roadway visibility is greatly improved.\", u\"After trying Sylvania Silverstar, which are roghly the same cost as the Philips Crystalvision, to find they didn't offer more illumination than the factory halogens, I considered an aftermarket HID conversion kit, but read that some conversion kits can cause damage to the wiring harness.\", u'With that, I decided to skip the conversion kit and give the Philips CrystalVision Ultra bulbs a try.', u'Installation is the same as with any bulb with the fit being an exact duplicate of the OEM.', u'The light produced by the Philips Crystalvision bulbs is notably whiter (with a slight tint of blue) and brighter than the Sylvania Silverstar, which were an improvement over the factory halogen bulbs, closely resembling HID.', u\"The cost of a pair of Crystalvision bulbs is less than even the cheapest HID conversion kit being sold on flea-Bay, but they are a direct replacement of the factory bulbs and won't cause damage to your wiring harness.\", u\"I've been riding around with these bulbs installed for about a month and I'm extremely pleased with their performance.\", u\"So much so that I'm planning to purchase a pair to replace the factory installed halogens in my high-beams, and eventually the factory installed H11 halogen bulbs in my vehicle's fog lamps.\", u'Highly recommended.', u'I replaced the original lights on my 2010 toyota sequioa.', u'I like the look, bright white light, no glare, no blue tint,  good visibility to the sides, illuminates the road better than the oem bulbs Great Match for my Morimoto Retro-kit!!!', u'These lights came in advertising 4100K.', u'My retro-kit is 4300K, they match VERY well.', u'Nice bulb at a great price.', u'And this is based on experience.I plugged a pair of Sylvania SilverStar Ultra headlights into my previous car, a 1996 Subaru Legacy.', u'Displeased with the results, I restored the headlight lenses with the 3M kit.', u\"The lenses were crystal clear to the naked eye and the light thrown by the SilverStars appeared pure white from the driver's seat but head-on the headlights still revealed a trace of yellow.\", u'In addition to oxidation, plastic headlight lenses yellow over time on the inside.', u'The only 100% solution: replace the lenses.That said, when I replaced the stock low-beams on my 2013 Subaru Impreza hatchback, the CrystalVision Ultra H11s delivered 99.99999% of the marketing claims.', u\"The light output is pure white from both the driver's seat and to oncoming traffic but without the harsh glare of misaligned or aftermarket HIDs.\", u\"At certain angles, one can see a trace of the blue tips in the reflector but it's not the cheesy blue of non-steet-legal bulbs.\", u'Longevity is unknown at this time, but I donated the Legacy to charity with the SilverStars installed after at least three years of nighttime-only operation (the Impreza uses the 9005 high-beams as daytime running lights).', u'We can only hope the CrystalVisions perform as well.', u'This is the second pair I have purchased for my Jetta and these are by far the best bulbs I have used when compared to the other three I previously ran: Anzo, X-treme Bright and Silverstars.', u'There is a white output which brightens the road at night, even highlighting pot holes on my daily route that the other bulbs did not show.', u'Definitely worth the $$$.', u\"I bought the Crystal Vision's to compare to the Silverstar Ultra's I had in my 2010 Fusion.\", u\"The Silverstars are rated at 4100K, and the Crystal's at 4000K.\", u\"But what was strange, was the Crystal's were actually white with some blue to it, the Silverstars are still yellow.\", u\"I think it's a marketing scam with Sylvania.\", u'Philips seems to hold true to what they put out.', u'Philips all the way!', u'Very pleased!', u'Needed to replace a low beam headlamp on my Z4.', u'This did the trick just fine.', u'Seems to match the original and fairly easy to install.', u'HUGE improvement over my stock bulbs and only cost $20.', u'These are a really cheap and easy upgrade and are about as bright as you can get without going HID.', u'I like these lights they are DOT compliant.', u'Blue is illegal in My state.', u'These really light up the night.', u'I think they are whiter than Sylvania Silver Star.', u'I have Silver Star on my Fog LIghts and they are rated at 4000 K and so are these H11 lights.', u'The Philips are wihiter and do not match perfectly but close enough.', u'There is no blue in the light.', u'So dont think you are getting HID lights.', u'HID runs at 6000K not 4000K.', u'GO to your local hardware store that has LED home lights displayed and see what 4000K looks like its white.', u\"In my book, only HID's look like HID's, so buying these to make your headlights look more expensive is probably an exercise in futility.However... if you like bright, pure white light, the H11 CrystalVision bulbs absolutely demolish SilverStar Ultras, Nighthawk Sport, and Nighthawk Platinum -- and until today, I've been a very big Nighthawk fan.The color difference between OEM bulbs less than a year old and the CrystalVision bulbs was absolutely obvious on a newer Subaru Forester.\", u'I was expecting a bit more blue, but these are dead-on white.', u'The difference in driving was spectacular, too, as peripheral details really became more pronounced with these bulbs.', u\"And, while they're really bright, I didn't have any problems with oncoming traffic blinking at me.For the price, you really can't go wrong giving these a shot -- especially if you're due for replacement anyway.\", u\"I recently ordered this for an '07 Mazda3 s Sport.I was always frustrated by the poor light performance of the stock low beam bulbs with its short lighting distance, lackluster brightness, and off white/yellow color.\", u\"I had to get something different and after some research, I ended up getting these bulbs and boy, what a difference!The lights are more towards the whiter end with an VERY slight tinge of yellow and blue if you look at it from certain angles, but that's only if you look REALLY carefully.\", u'The light output is considerably higher which is a HUGE plus and the lighting distance is about twice the distance of the OEM lightbulbs.Good range + good light output + 4000k color temp = Safer.', u\"You'll be able to see obstacles in the distance & one wouldn't need to turn on high beams as often on dark roads.I'd very much would rather spend the money on mid-$20 headlight bulbs and prevent accidents from happening rather than paying $1000+ for damage repair.\", u\"Wouldn't you?\", u';) 3 of my motorcycles use H7 bulbs for the regular (low beam) headlight.', u'I replaced all three with the Philips H7 CrystalVision bulb and the results were impressive.', u'The light output seems to be noticeably  higher, but the most impressive part is the light is bright white - not yellow.', u'You can see my videos on Youtube under RedonKiLaus.', u'It is somewhat brighter (less yellow) than the stock.', u'My 2013 Elantra GT has projector headlight and compared to the stock i see a bit of improvement.', u\"Its more white than blue, but def not close to the HID lights.My only concern is the longevity, and i'll keep you posted.\", u'Just installed these and it was a breeze.', u'I put one in and compared with stock and it was noticeably whiter and maybe even a tad brighter (then again that could be due to the whiter color).These are a good in-between from OEM halogen and those third-party HIDs.', u'The third-party HIDs are no good as they blind oncoming traffic.', u\"So for the price, these are worth it to me.Now we'll see how long these last, but the first install and test looks good.\", u'I prefer Philips brand when you are getting new headlight bulb if you want them more brighter, Silver Star burns out to fast compare to a Philip Brand.', u\"They went into my wife's 2009 Mercedes C300.\", u'The factory bulbs lasted 4.5 years.', u'After a week I have not heard any complaints from the driver.', u'These bulbs are much brighter than the stock ones.', u'You will notice the difference once you put them in.', u'They provide a lot more light.']\n"

      "[u'good towels.', u\"fast shipping The first microfiber cloths I ever used wereMeguiar's Supreme Shine Microfiber Cloths (Pack of 3).\", u'I loved `em.', u'But I wanted to try the Zwipes since they were so much cheaper per sheet.They arrived in a medium sized box and I was surprised to discover that they filled up the entire box.', u'There was no other packaging.', u\"So I just continued to use the box to store the Zwipes as I used `em.The Zwipes aren't as big (in surface area) as the Meguiar's.\", u\"And they aren't as thick, either.\", u\"But they are just as effective at cleaning every last bit of dirt and dust from my car's surface and windows.Surprisingly, the bright colors - yellow, lime and blue - allowed me to use the Zwipes elsewhere in my house.\", u'They work great in cleaning furniture, mirrors, shower doors, sinks, faucets, appliances, counter tops, you name it.', u'I now use them everywhere.', u\"I also learned to useMeguiar's Ultimate Quik Wax 15.2oz Liquid Spray Bottleto polish the surfaces to a mirror-like shine.\", u'(This spray-on wax has a nice berry-like smell.)', u\"But please don't tell my friends.\", u\"It's like my own little secret.As a tip: a big package of 36 microfiber wipes in the traditional yellow/brown color, and just as thick and almost as large as the Meguiar's, are also available at Costco for a very low price.To conclude, I don't know how I lived without microfiber cloths before.\", u'With Zwipes I can now use them everywhere - and I do.', u'This is a product I highly recommend.', u'Enjoy.', u'little small and skimpy but it gets the job done.Costco towels are better imo for the money but I like the verity of colors.', u'I like this  microfiber cloth.', u'They have many uses around the house - for dusting and cleaning up.', u'It works wonders on TV and computer screens.', u'However my favorite use for them is for cleaning the car.', u'They are slightly smaller than another set of microfiber cloths I have, and they work better for washing, applying back-to-black treatment to bumpers, and for apply car wax.', u'I use a larger microfiber tower for drying (where slightly larger and thicker so I can use fewer towels for the job).Another great use I found by them is by sewing two of them together to form a mitt for my window washer.', u'I have a tall SUV and cannot reach across the windshield all the way to clean it.', u'Using the extended reach of the window wash squeegee with a microfiber towel mitt on it gives me streak free window with very little effort.', u'Once the the mitt on the squeegee I tied to the handle with a string to keep it from sliding off.', u'I have one mitt for washing and one mitt for drying.I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates.', u'There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called  \"Online Price Alert\".', u'This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify.', u'If you search on \"online price alert\" in Google it will be come up at the top.', u'I find this tool to be very helpful.', u'You can really use these cloths for anything.', u'I use them in the kitchen to wipe hands instead of wasting paper towels.', u'I also use them on my car.', u'The quality is good and they hold up to washing with no problem.', u\"I've seen one of these in the auto store for $5 each.\", u'Good deal here.', u'Had a dozen microfiber cloths for many years but until recently did not know how much more I could be using them.', u'These Zwipes are far less expensive than any brand, anywhere and the finest quality.You will have them forever and be able to share such a large package.Great value!Use for furniture, bathrooms, appliances, jewelry, shoes, woodwork, upholstery etc.', u'And if you wish, no cleaning solution is needed, just dampen; and then dry off with another cloth.Update:  Just ordered another big batch of these cleaning cloths as more and more friends and family wish to try.', u\"So it is shared and then they can purchase their own 'stash'!\", u'Good product to clean my car.', u'Fiber is nice and really cleans anything on the surface.', u'Also absorb water well.', u\"I purchased these for my husband who washes cars and he said that he needed more so I ordered eurow microfiber premium 16x16 350 gsm 36 pack from amazon just to try something different and he loves the eurow's brand better because they are a lot thicker and made of better quality material and is cheaper than zwipes.\", u'While zwipes still gets the job done they are better for using on glass.', u'Where as eurow is better for removing polish or wax off the vehicle.', u'These cloths are a great value, but they could be better.', u'If the manufacturer would take the proper finishing steps, this would be a super product.', u'Mine came with a lot of \"fuzz\" and stray bits of material on the cloths (shake one and see) and a faint chemical residue smell.', u'If these had been washed/rinsed before packaging, they would be super, as it is, I suggest running these through a cold water wash cycle once or twice before using them.For anyone wondering, these are the coarse micofiber style for general purpose cleaning, not the fine microfiber such as used for cleaning cameras and lenses.', u'Fine for LCD screens, TV screens and such, though.', u'A good choice to pack with your laptop.A good cleaning cloth at a fair price.---------------------------------------------Update: 2011-11-19 Upped my rating to 4 stars as these cloths have held up well and I use them a lot for daily cleaning.', u'Just be sure to wash before first use!', u'I have bought 2 boxes of these now.', u'I gave half of the box to my dad and he likes them too.', u'I replaced paper napkins with these microfiber from now on.', u'I just wash them and they are good for round two.', u'Use them to clean my truck after I polish.', u'I use these mainly when waxing my car, as then buff to a great shine without leaving any lint, and the car wax I use seems to wash out cleanly.The size is good, and overall they feel comfortable in your hand.', u'Never known one to leave lint, and they seem to hold up well to repeated washings.', u'Still, I\\'m not the type who feels comfortable \"washing\" my car with one of these and a little water - but that doesn\\'t mean I won\\'t use them to apply/remove wax.Great product at a fair price...definitely recommended.', u'These are great universal use microfiber cloths.', u\"I wouldn't use them on the exterior of my car, or even the interior, but that's because I'm OCD.\", u'I would use them on everything else though for sure (and I do).', u\"For the price and quality it's hard to beat.\", u'Far superior to the ones you would find at w-mart or t-get.', u'The tag removes cleanly, no rough spots to scratch really, they clean well in a washer, and so far have lasted several washes with plenty of life left in them.', u'Love these towels.', u'Ordered 24 earlier for my car detailing hobby and boy i was not let down.', u'They are great, very very very impressed.', u\"So impressed that I had to order 24 more......Don't let these get away from you.\", u\"Order'em I bought these on impulse when I saw them on a lightning deal -- the claim that they avoided the need for cleaners was what got me.I'm a skeptic -- but I can confirm, for darkwood furniture, they remove dust and some light stains (toddler milk stains, etc.)\", u\"with just a little elbow grease.In the car, they dust and give everything a quick wipe down pretty easy and when they get kind of grungy you can use them for wash or dry cloths for the car.The 36-pack comes with 3 different colors, so this let us color-code where we used the different towels so we didn't mistakenly use car towels in the house.More cost effective than the Meguiars microfiber towels and pretty good around the house for dusting and cleaning granite counters -- I'd recommend these for those uses.\", u\"I'm holding 1 star to see how well they last over time.\", u'After some 30 years of washing cars, I finally figured out the secret: a giant stack of microfiber cloths.', u'I use these on the windows with window cleaner, on the interior with 303 Aerospace Protectant, and the body after washing and waxing.', u'The trick is having enough cloths that you can always grab a clean one whenever you might want.', u'And you can toss them in the wash and restock the pile!48 cloths has been enough for full detailing of two cars and several quick washes.', u'I still have about a third of the pile left.', u'I have used microfiber cloths for years.', u'Love them as dishtowels, dish rags, cleaning rags etc.', u'This set is a good price.', u'They make good towels to wipe electronics with, no cleaner needed, simply wipe  And windows and mirrors too.', u'I like that.I also wanted a few extra to carry in the car to wipe things down without using cleaners etc.', u\"I've never seen one ever scratch a surface.These aren't as big as some I've seen, but that's exactly what I was looking for.I am no so organized as to use only certain colors in certain rooms etc.\", u'But you could...Just remember no bleach and NO fabric softener and your good to go.', u'I do use white vinegar in the wash sometimes with these.', u'Love this stuff.', u'Absorbs and dries fantastically!', u'I rate better than a chamois cloth becuz of ease wringing out the water.', u'1st wipe leaves small tiny droplets of water, 2nd wipe and whatever is all dried.', u\"Usually I don't wash, dry or wax my old cars at all.\", u'Trying to keep my new car NEW!', u'and have been washing/waxing with these cloths, and its never been easier.', u\"I'm extolling probably most brands of MICROFIBER cloths.\", u'I use two of these when using a spray wax after each wash, one to apply, another to buff.', u'Very good quality as it does not scratch my black trucks.', u'However, they are not thick and for using on a pick up, you should use a set for each side and then one for the roof/hood (six cloths) if you are the type that is very particular on your vehicle shine.', u'If not picky, one set would work fine.', u'I love the multicolored packages of wipes.', u'These are high quality and last a long time.', u'My only negative is the inability to orders cloths of particular colors since I use a color coded system in detailing cars.', u'I really want more DARK GREEN clothes.', u'As I stain them, lose them and give some to friends...I will keep ordering them from Amazon.', u'I love microfiber.', u\"It's wonderful.\", u'You can use it for just about anything.', u\"Clothing, upholstery, bedding, cleaning cloths - it's everywhere now and there's a good reason.\", u\"It's incredibly soft, sturdy, and absorbent.\", u'There are variations in quality though.', u'For all-purpose cloths, these are a great deal, and you stock up to boot.', u\"These cloths don't look that sturdy, but they are.\", u'Keep a dozen in the kitchen, you may never buy paper towels again.', u'You can clean just about anything with them.', u'There are better cloths for polishing glass, but these will work.', u\"They're also good for dusting off your keyboard.\", u\"Why don't you do that right now?\", u\"It probably needs it.These would make a good practical gift for any teen or adult.Update:  2014  I'm still using my original package of 36.\", u\"Some have got quite thin, but I haven't needed more for myself.\", u\"I've re-purchased and gifted new packs to several people.\", u\"OK, they didn't look thrilled at first, but once they started using them, they fell all over themselves thanking me.ZWIPES gets the rare and envied HB seal of approval.\", u\"I consider this one of, if not the best purchase I've ever made on Amazon.\", u'Two wings up!', u\"I'm not sure if praising cleaning towels means having Manly Points deducted, but these little towels are amazing.\", u'Extremely versatile, they can be used for everything from washing the car without risking micro scratches on the paint to washing dishes.', u\"They're reusable, of course, so make much more sense than wasteful paper towels.\", u'Microfiber cloth is electrostatic by nature and so attracts dust like a magnet.', u'Their design also allows them to be effective in removing many types of dirt without the use of any additional chemicals making them safer for use especially with households that have infants and children or persons with allergies or hypersensitivity to chemicals.', u\"They're more absorbent than a sponge and since you're more likely to toss them in the washing machine than a kitchen sponge, they're much more sanitary, since the kitchen sponge is said to be the most germ infested location in the entire house.\", u'Even the multiple colors they arrive in is a plus if you want to designate one color for car use, one for kitchen only and one for misc.', u'cleaning.', u\"As with any fabric product, it's always a good idea to do an initial laundering before using them to dry or clean anything food or kitchen related.\", u\"Don't use fabric softener, though, when washing them as the oils in those products will clog the microfibers and reduce the cloth's effectiveness.\", u'It might be noted that microfiber is made from synthetic materials that are petrochemical based and so are not biodegradable and can emit toxins when burned.', u\"Also, towels used on sensitive surfaces like your car's paint, should kept separate for that use only, since other applications might embed particles in the fibers and make micro-scratches more likely.\", u'This is one high tech product that really makes many low tech chores a lot easier and more effective.', u'I am a microfiber fan and use this over cotton cloths.', u'It is easy to use and clean.', u\"It comes in a perfect size and buying the 48-pack will ensure I will have these at a moment's notice Love these microfiber rags.\", u'We use them for so many chores in and outside our motorhome.', u'Would definitely purchase again.', u'Picked these up since all of my old towels are pretty much done with.', u'Used two of them yesterday for polishing.', u'And when I tell you that they are soft and apply and take off the polishing compound easily, it does.', u'I would buy more of these when the time is needed.', u'IN fact, as soon as I am done writing this review, I will purchase some more.', u\"Microfiber so far is microfiber, they all seem to clean about the same, some leave behind a little less lent than others but for the price these aren't bad.\", u'Now that being said these are smallest microfiber wash-cloths I have ever seen.', u'Seriously they are the same size as most washcloths, they are tiny!', u'The package makes them seem bigger than they are.', u'I purchased these to clean my car but they can be used around the house as well.', u'They are so soft that using them to clean anything with a nice surface is no problem.I use them to clean the windows, wipe down the interior and then the door jambs.', u\"After I'm done they are very machine washable and come out looking like new again.\", u'I bought a 12 pack but have actually only used several of them over and over again.The only thing I find weird is how they feel in my hand.', u'Maybe they are just too soft for my beat up aging guy hands but when I use them they just feel weird.', u\"Can't explain it!\", u'I have two dogs so I have lots of dust and pet dander everywhere, all the time.', u'When I drag a regular cloth towel over, say, the dashboard of my car, all it does is make the dust and dander float around for a bit and then settle back down.', u'With these, all that crud just vanishes into the cloth.', u'Seriously.', u\"It's magic.\", u'I had the same problem in the car with my regular and dark glasses; they always had crud on them.', u\"I'd wipe them but all that would do is move the crud around on the lens.\", u\"One lick with these and it's just gone.They are washable and you get a bunch of them.\", u'I now have them strategically placed in the car console, the drawer next to my black smooth stovetop (which shows dust badly), in the bathroom.', u'If you have any kind of dust, pollen, pet dander issues these are a must have.', u'I had been hearing about microfiber cleaning cloths, but I finally decided to give them a try when replacement pads for our spray mop were unreasonably high.', u'I am sold!', u'I cut the cloths in half, they stick perfectly well to our Libman Freedom spray mop.', u'Better yet, they have so many other uses!Initially I assigned them to various tasks by color code.', u'Yellow were assigned to personal care, green for windows and mirrors and blue for grimier tasks.', u'Eventually as the cloths become somewhat worn, I cut them in half then they are dedicated to the spray mop.', u'If I need to use a smaller cloth, I just cut them in half &#34;early&#34; and keep them separate from the floor cloths until they are &#34;worn&#34; a bit and ready to be reassigned to care for our floors.', u\"As the final step I use the most worn microfiber cloths for cleaning the toilet, once they've bit the dust they are then discarded.\", u\"I've already saved more than the cost of these wipes since we no longer use nearly as many paper towels.\", u'They are super easy to rinse out - dirt and grime wash away, fur and hair sometimes need some encouragement to &#34;release&#34; from the microfiber.', u'The cloths do really well in our HE washer.', u\"Since it spins them so thoroughly we just hang to dry and they're ready for their next cleaning task.\", u'Never use fabric softener, it will ruin the &#34;microfiber grabbing power&#34; of the cloths.Did I mention windows and mirrors?', u'We make a solution of 5 parts white vinegar, 5 parts water and 2 parts alcohol (rubbing alcohol or vodka) to clean our windows and mirrors (it also makes a great all purpose cleaning solution!)', u'This solution works very well with these microfiber cloths, in fact now we no longer use nearly as much of our spray solution if I start with an already slightly damp microfiber cloth.', u'I will definitely buy again when we need more microfiber cloths.', u'I love these microfiber cloth!', u'I use them to clean everything!', u'Mostly for my cars!', u'They do not leave scratches on your car and can be use for almost anything!', u'Very good quality microfiber cloths.', u'Excellent for leaving everywhere to clean glass, glasses, etc.', u'Ordered these a few times, since we tend to get them so filthy we have to dispose of them.Word of warning, they melt.', u'I used microfiber in the past and just love the way they pick up dirt and stuff.', u'These I got a 36-pack for like 23 dollars.', u'That is quite a good deal considering buying these seperate can cost 2-3 dollars.', u\"Anyways, the size isn't too large and it isn't too small, it's perfect.\", u\"I also got 12 yellow, 12 green, and 12 blue which I was hoping because I didn't want all one color like some people claimed.\", u'I took the advice from someone else who ordered them.', u'I have the blue ones in the garage for the car, the yellow in the kitchen for the countertop and dishes, and the green ones upstairs in the laundry room for upstairs use.', u\"Each one has a tag on it on how to wash it and stuff, which I don't like but I don't want to pull it off and ruin the towel so it will stay on I guess.\", u'Anyways, I bought these for cleaning my car so it gets dry and I use them for dusting.', u\"It's a dust magnet, the stuff really shines after quickly wiping them off with one of these towels.\", u'Good towels and definately worth the money without question.', u':Update:So I have been using these things for a couple days and let me tell you, what a great value for what you get.', u'These things pick up stuff so well.', u'I just washed our kitchen floor with one of them and it picked up almost every single hair and particle imaginable.', u'It used to take me like 5 wipes across with a regular rag to get the stuff but it sticks to one of these things so simple.', u'I hope it comes out in the wash though, I tried to squeeze some of the stuff out and some came out but not everything.', u'Either way it made the cleaning so much easier.', u\"Maybe I will have a dirty one dedicated to just the kitchen floor so I don't ruin them all.\", u\"Anyways, go out and get these things you won't regret it.\", u\"They are worth more than a dollar a piece and Amazon's deal is fantastic.\", u':Update-2:I have had this same pack of 36 for probably a year now.', u'I am down to my last few though, so I am going to re-order.', u'I used them very heavily and 23 dollars lasting me a year, these things are way worth it.', u'I used them to clean my car interior/windows.', u'I used them to clean kitchen sinks and coffee tables.', u'The dust these things pick up is remarkable.', u'I used them very heavily to clean our tile kitchen floor and wooden floors.', u\"I think that's the reason I threw some out because they got so picked up with dirt and grime.\", u'Our kitchen floors take in heavy traffic and after using these with some all purpose cleaner on the kitchen floor, it looks like new.', u'For dusting stuff off they are amazing.', u\"I don't know what else to say, but I am pretty sure this is the longest review I have here on Amazon, and I have quite a few reviews.\", u'These things have made our house spick and span, and I am a very picky cleaner.', u\"You won't regret getting these, they save so much money from not spending and wasting paper towels.\", u'great price for microfiber cleaning cloths....reasonable quality.', u'great for a multitude of cleaning responsibilities.', u'I use these instead of dish rags, to wipe up small spills, clean the bathroom, dust the furniture and clean windows.', u'(Not the same one of course).', u'Then I throw them in the wash and reuse them.', u'Make sure when you wash or put them in the dryer do not use a softener.', u'Ordered these December 6th 2013.', u'Unlike the 2011 reviewer, I cannot \"literally see right through them\".', u'They are thick and soft.', u'I tried them on my vehicles and then drove them in the bright post-snowstorm sunlight.', u'They passed my first 3 acceptance criteria for microfiber towels: Absorbent, oil free, and lint free.', u'These are now my go-to choice compared to many others including HF (worst) and WM sourced (OK) towels.', u'It remains to be seen how long they will last.', u'I recommend soaking them in Sno Seal Sport Wash (Sno Seal 14479 SPORT LAUNDRY DETERGENT), hand rinsing them, and then a standard laundry cycle with Sport Wash, no bleach or fabric softener.', u'Keep in mind they will pick up some lint in the dryer, but not too much, this may or may not be acceptable for you.', u'Recently I purchased the Zwipes Microfiber cleaning cloths to clean the windows in my car.', u'They worked great for the task.', u'Yesterday I decided to use one for dishwashing and counter-top and appliance cleaning.', u'All I can say is the product description that Amazon shows is 100% correct.', u'They clean without chemicals and they will hold many times their weight in water.', u\"They wash dishes like nothing I've ever used before.\", u\"I'm totally blown away by how good they perform!\", u'The old dish cloth would streak my counter-tops when I wiped them down but the Zwipes leaves no streaks whatsoever.', u'When I hold one under the faucet it fills with water and feels like a sponge!', u'I bought a box of 36 and still have 33 left and the ones I have used I throw in my clothes washer to clean and use them again

definately given me far more than what I expected.\", u\"I'm sure I'll find many more uses for Zwipes in the future.\", u'I am looking for quality, but inexpensive, microfiber cloths that I can use to detail the car and clean the house.', u'These fit the bill as I can use these in my daily cleaning.', u'12 x 16 is a good size for quad-folding.', u'Still debating in my mind vs. using 16 x 16 cloths.', u'Need to remove the tags from these before use and may want to wash first to remove manufacturing lint.', u\"I bought a bunch of these because I'm always using them to wash my car.\", u\"I like the assorted colors; it helps me remember what is for window cleaner, exterior, interior, etc.They don't shed, they've survived multiple washings, and I still have all of them after nearly 6 months of use.\", u'Plus, they are about 60 cents each.', u\"Go to Wal Mart and they're about double - or more.\", u'Not sure what other brands are like, but these are nice and clean well.', u'I use them for home and my car.', u'For the price, you should buy them as you will have a lot to change from.', u'These are 12&#34; x 16&#34; so they are not as large.', u'They are also a bit on thin side but they work excellently.', u'I use them to clean a few things around the house and applying any car care products.', u\"Don't bother to use them to wipe the entire car though.\", u'Get another size as you will take a year to use these to wipe your car.', u'THESE ARE GREAT MICROFIBER TOWELS.', u'THEY WORK GREAT.', u\"JUST DON'T DRY IN DRYER.\", u'HANG DRY AND THEY WORK GREAT.', u'POLISH,CLEAN ANYTHING WITHOUT SCRATCHING.', u'I BOUGHT TWO OF THE 36 TOWEL PACKAGES AS I USE THEM FOR EVERYTHING.', u\"THANKS I've had other microfiber wipes that just become a magnet for lint when place in the dryer.\", u'Clean well when placed in the washer.', u'I dry them on low and have had no problems.These absorb large spillsClean glass and mirrors without leaving streaks or lintGreat for cleaning outdoor furniture that has many layers of pollen and dust.I use these like paper towels and even with sticky gooey messes they clean the mess and wash up easily.', u'I bought these some time ago.I use them mainly to detail my vehicles, cleaning glass is great, just don\\'t use too much glass spray and your windows will turn up crystal clear.I use them \"dry\" to dust my dash/ door handle, etc...though you can use a quick spritz of some interior detail spray to make it even better.Keep a few in the car incase the windows fog up, these worked great.And you can use in the house as well.....things you can wipe down are only limited to your imagination.', u'I do love microfibers because it is easy to wash and quick to to dry as opposed to cotton towels.', u'This has medium thickness.', u'At 16\" x 12\",  this is just the perfect size, not too big and not too small.', u\"I also bought a Vroom orange microfiber before which is much bigger and thicker, but they are more difficult to work around with.I use it everywhere; in the kitchen, for cleaning cars, on my computer monitor, and even to clean CD & DVD's.\", u'They are lint free.', u'It is also easier to wipe when it is wet because it glides faster unlike cotton that drags on the surface.It will not wipe water off completely or as streakless as compared to chamois or my other favorite, \"Synthetic Absorber\".', u'But for the value and usefulness, microfiber is the way to go.', u'This is a bargain and the cloths wipe very well leaving little to no streaks on glass, paint etc.', u'I use these on my car and also, when doing projects around the house.', u'They absorb well and wash out easy for reuse.', u'Some lint tends to be released but a good shaking tends to fix this along with removing the tag that tends to get in the way.', u\"Surprisingly great little cleaning towels.I replaced some ancient cotton rags and old kitchen towels with these microfiber cloths, and couldn't be more pleased with the results.\", u\"They seem to be just as absorbent as cotton toweling, and the textured surface does a good job of scrubbing off dirt and soap-scum.They don't seem to shed at all, and after several wash/dry cycles, they look good as new, other than that the edges are curled in slightly, probably from the heat of the dryer.\", u\"Having three colors in my pack of 24 is smart, since I can assign different colors to different parts of the house (ie, yellow is the master-bath)-- that way I don't have to remember how many cloths to put back in each location.Must-have for cleaning, and it's environmentally friendly to use reusable towels.\", u'I expect these towels to last me for quite a while.', u'Highly recommended.', u\"What can you say about a box of Rags well a fair bitI started using microfiber towels a few years ago am amazed at how well they work so figured no more disappearing microfiber towels any more got a box of them now just have to hide them so my mates don't help themselves to clean their bikes (LOL) I used half of these for lifting up car wax and half for cleaning windshields.\", u\"They are a tiny bit on the thin side, but for the price, I think you'd be hard pressed to beat them.\", u'Not worth deducting a star.', u'This microfiber cloths are like no other, they will pick up/off almost anything.', u'I use it for everything, from dusting to using them for detailing my car.', u'These are amazing little things.', u'These are very handy to have in the garage.', u'I use them for many small clean up jobs and when using my detail spray.', u'There are so many that as I get near the end of the stack I can easily throw them in the washer and be ready for the next project.', u'They are small of course and not really good for waxing the car.', u'Nice product at a fair price.', u'I use these for wiping down my motorcycle after applying Honda spray cleaner and polish.', u'Not much else to say.', u'I would order these gain in a heartbeat.', u'Looks like good quality but a bit small for major car cleaning.', u'You might want to look for something larger for bigger jobs.', u'as described - they are very useful and come out of the wash nicely - when these wear out i will order again Affordable, and they work as advertised.', u'I use these for drying/waxing my car.', u\"They've been through the laundry several times, and still work great.\", u\"The only thing that I don't like are the labels, but those can easily be snipped off.\", u'Great price.... great product.', u\"It's great having a large amount of microfiber clothes around the house.\", u'Perfect for the garage, perfect for any room in the house if cleaning is your thing.', u'I use to buy 3 packs or 6 packs and always run out and wish I had more.', u'Best thing I did was buy a 36 pack!', u'Go ahead and make the purchase, you will not be disappointed.', u\"For the price, you can't complain about these MF cloths.I recommend better quality cloths for detailing painted car body panels, but these work nicely for detailing interior/exterior panels, engine bay, and wheels.Expect to fall apart after a couple of uses and washes (8+ washes) I got the 12 pack of Zwipes Microfiber of Cleaning Cloths and they are killer for all kinds of home usage.We use them in the kitchen, bathroom counters and even when I Armor All the inside of my car and outside of my scooter.Seems like a silly thing to be writing about but a great cloth makes a big difference and I'm not even a clean freak.\", u'You never have enough cleaning cloths.', u'Now I have plenty.', u'Great for cleaning, and can be thrown into the washer to make them like new.', u'I use for waxing, and general cleanup, and they were inexpensive.', u\"We have mostly all started to convert to LCD's and Plasmas at some location in our homes...whether its for TV or computer.\", u'Well, there are a few ways to clean them....buy a LCD cleaning kit which costs $$ or find a better cheaper and similar solution.', u'Well I did just that.These microfiber wipes not only help you clean a CAR.....they help you clean your flat panels without any liquid.I have been using one to clean an LCD panel that sits in our Family Room....it gets dusty in there....', u'This puppy grabs all of the dirt and the best part is there are NO smudges.Now I know sometimes we get stuff on our screens that needs that essential liquid touch....for that you should find a small bottle of liquid lcd cleaner so u can use it when necessary.Regular cleaning with these will get the dust off and not scratch the surface.UPDATE: 03/13/09 - Friday the 13thThese continue to amaze me in my office and in my home.', u'I work for a medium sized company in IT and we have switched away from other types of fabric/paper cleaners to these Microfiber cloths.', u'We use them on all of our LCD screens and on our larger then life Plasma displays.', u'It has been months and I have yet to hear a complaint and or see a SCRATCH.', u'THESE are perfect and a great value.', u'Also...lets not forget the GREEN aspect of these....36 of these can probably replace hundreds if not thousands of paper towels....save paper...save trees.', u'Simple Concept.', u'I use these cloths for all sorts of things: dusting, cleaning computer monitors, cleaning the inside of my car, etc.', u'They have worked well so far.', u\"I have not put any of them through the wash yet, but I have no reason to believe they wouldn't survive.\", u'I am quite satisfied with them and would not hesitate to purchase more.', u\"good cloths does its job good for house cleaning and glass so far survived 3 washes not bad for the price paid on lightening deals I don't think you can find any better value than this on good microfiber cloths.\", u'These are great for kitchen counters, car garages and much more.', u'there are so many usage for these.', u'THe price is awsome.', u'The quality of the cloths are very good as well.']\n"

      "[u'I generally liked this product.', u'I loved its being so much smaller and lighter than traditional battery chargers.', u'However, there was a big issue and a variety of small annoyances.The big issue I encountered was that the charger never transitioned to Maintenance mode (trickle-charge).', u\"I had used the car in a way that didn't recharge the battery (series of very short trips on a cold night with a passenger that insisted on using the electric seat heater).\", u\"I could hear the weaker rev'ing of the starter.\", u'When I got home, I connected up this charger, but 8 hours later, the status lights indicated normal charging mode, when I would have expected it to have long been in trickle charge.', u'However, the battery seemed to have been fully recharged (from healthy sound from the starter motor).Related to this is the absence of a finer-grained charging status, for example a 3- or 4-element bar.', u'On traditional battery chargers there is a gauge showing the voltage difference between the battery and what the charger is supplying.', u'As the battery charges, the needle on this gauge drops.', u\"This lets you know when you are close to charged, or that the battery isn't taking a charge.\", u'And when you are initially connecting the clips, it helps confirm that you have a good connection.', u\"For example, I know from prior experience with these traditional chargers that there are several bolts on my engine block that would seem to be excellent grounding points, but aren't (insulated by thread-lock glue?).\", u'When I experimented by attempting to use these bolts, this charger gave me no indication of this problem -- the status lights were the same as when I connected to a good ground.', u\"Consequently you don't get an indication of one of the most common problems using a charger -- an inadequate connection of the clips.The hanging hook is a very useful feature.\", u'Unfortunately it seems to be made of a very brittle plastic.', u'While it may be adequate for hanging the charger on a wall, it is grossly inadequate for the pictured use of hanging from the hood latch -- a situation when you are likely to be frazzled and may inadvertently stress the hook.', u'When I encounter features that apparently compromise quality for trivial cost-savings, I always wonder if there are hidden ones critical to the functioning of the device.The product is better than what is pictured.', u'Instead of a cord ending in battery clips, it has theBosch C35AC0 Quick Connect Cable Harness for C3 Battery Charger with Built-in Cable Fuseto which the battery clips are then connected.', u\"This harness provides the option -- which I didn't test -- of being left attached to a battery to provide a simpler and surer connection of the charger, and is especially useful for infrequently used batteries that are maintained on trickle charge (for example, boats, classic cars).\", u\"Also, if the charger is to be used by someone who just can't understand the concept of where to connect the clips, this is an excellent accommodation.\", u'If you use the charger with multiple batteries, you might consider getting some/all of them their own harnesses.', u'Additionally, my experience is that this is the part of a charger most likely to be damaged, and it is an advantage that it is easily replaceable.Although the manual is very short, it could be much better organized and laid out.', u'Before you get to the two pages of operating instructions, it has four pages of warnings that should be obvious to almost anyone likely to be using this charger.', u'I know that these are required to be there, but the way they are presented may well cause impatient or easily frustrated people to just stop reading.', u'The big annoyance involves a very nice feature: The cover folds out so you can see a keyed picture of the charger while you are reading the instructions.', u'Unfortunately, the legend for the keys (numbers) is not provided until after those names are being used (in the \"Warnings\").', u'And the basic instructions for operating the charger, including turning it to Standby before unplugging, is not in the \"Operating Instructions\" but part of a long individual \"Warning\" at the end of the \"Warnings\" section, and consequently easily to miss.DEFICIENCY: The manual for this product is available only as hardcopy.', u'Because so many of my product manuals are available in electronic form, my \"bookshelf\" is on my computer and portable devices.', u'This had the advantage of not only having manuals readily available and easily searchable, but it is easy for me to add annotations and bookmarks (I use the free FoxIt Reader as alternatives to Adobe Acrobat as well asNitro PDF Professional V6that is much cheaper than Acrobat, especially during its frequent sales and rebate offers).DEFICIENCY: No registration for this product.', u\"In the old days of mail-in registration cards, processing them was often an expense that wasn't worth it.\", u'But on-line registration is very inexpensive and something I would think well worth it for notifying customers in case a problem/defect is discovered in this product.What were they thinking?', u': The manual suggests using the packaging for storage, but that packaging is probably too fragile for anything but infrequent use where you are very careful taking it out and putting it back in: The cover is very thin plastic (reinforce-able or mend-able with normal packaging tape), and the base is a little more substantial.', u\"The packaging is closer to what you want to minimize the amount going into the waste stream.========================Advice for purchasers:The manual tells you to cycle the charger into standby mode (blue ring) before unplugging it (but doesn't say whether that is to protect the device or you).\", u'I found this to be non-obvious and thus hard to remember.', u'I used my label maker to put this reminder on the charger (but Bosch, it would be nice if you had this on the next version).-- Douglas B. Moran Simplicity and performance are two of the numerous characteristics that define this charger.', u'It is a leap forward in technology from the old square metal-cased charger that was the norm.', u'It is simple to hook up and with just one push of a button it goes about its business efficiently and thoroughly.', u'Easy to use and easy to store.', u'Another winner from Bosch.', u\"This isn't one of the giant wheeled battery chargers, heavy duty, meant for farm use.\", u'This one is designed for a motorcycle (has a 6v mode as well), or a car (such as a sports/classic car that may sit a lot of the time).', u'Hooking it up is pretty straightforward, connect power, hook to the battery, and then select your mode on the charger.', u'For me there was only three options, motorcycle/car/AGM, I chose the AGM (as I have a non-gel Optima battery).', u'By morning the battery had been charged, and is on trickle charge.The hook on the device is very nice to attach to the hood, or some other object around the vehicle.', u'The only complaint I have is that a few of the cords are too short.', u'From the charger to the wall seems to be a bit short, had to use an extension car to get it in proper position by my car (although this may not be an issue for everyone, as my garage is quite large, and the car not by a wall).', u\"The other short cord is the detachable one that goes on the battery (this is also very nice, and additional hookups can be ordered inexpensively) doesn't seem to be long enough to tuck someplace where i can hook it up without opening the hood, I guess it's not meant for that.Overall this charger has a lot of functionality showing you exactly what is going on (if you hooked it up backwards, what it's doing, etc), a method to easily hook up to multiple cars, and plus comes with the Bosch name.\", u'Would recommend this.', u'Upon unboxing the Bosch Model  C3 6.3/12.6 VDC Battery Charger, it is immediately evident that  this is a high quality product characteristic of the Bosch name.', u'The C3 is very compact compared to the old car battery chargers of the past.', u'The charger is constructed of a high impact plastic and therefore not susceptible to rusting as were the old metal box chargers.', u'All mode and status displays are on the front of the charger, as well as the single mode select button.', u'The C3 is equipped with a heavy duty 120 VAC power cord as well as a durable DC charging cable.', u'The DC charging cable is equipped with in inline disconnect, allowing the supplied insulated alligator clips to be left connected to the battery between charges.', u'The DC charging cable is also equipped with an inline 10A automotive type fuse to provide short circuit protection to the C3 charger.The Bosch C3 battery charger is microprocessor controlled and hence should be considered a \"smart charger\".', u'The C3 is designed to the sense the charge state of the battery, as well as determine the appropriate charge rate.', u'The C3 can provide a pulsed charging current of up to 3.5 A  for deeply discharged batteries, as well as provide a low current trickle or maintenance charge.', u'The C3 continuously monitors the battery charge state and automatically reverts from pulse to trickle charging when the battery is fully charged.The Bosch C3 battery charger was tested on a moderately discharged Delco S2000 115 AH deep cycle battery.', u'As expected, the C3 immediately switched to pulse charging, remaining in the pulse mode for approximately 7 hours before reverting to a trickle charge mode.The Bosch C3 battery charger performed flawlessly.The 36 page Bosch C3 instruction manual  is very well written and printed in 3 languages, English, French and Spanish.', u'Bosch strongly emphasizes operating safety.', u'The manual clearly addresses the potential for charging wet cell batteries to \"off gas\", thereby creating an explosive atmosphere.', u'Therefore, the charger should never be connected or disconnected from the battery while the battery is charging.', u'Bosch also cautions the user from operating the charger in wet conditions.Bosch emphasizes that this charger is only designed to charge 6.3 or 12.6 VDC wet cell or gel cell rechargeable batteries.', u'It is not designed to charge dry cell batteries.The Bosch C3 Automatic Battery Charger is packaged with the C3 automatic charger, a battery charging cable equipped with a disconnect and an inline 10 A automotive fuse, red and black insulated heavy duty alligator clamps, a removable hanger and an operating manual.', u'Bosch provides a generous 2 year limited warranty on parts and workmanship.The Bosch C3 Automatic Battery Charger is a high quality product that should provide many years of reliable service when used in accordance with the supplied operating instructions.', u\"Although the C3 isn't designed for high current vehicle starting applications, it proves to be very versatile for many battery charging applications.The only shortcoming found with the Bosch C3 charger is that the AC line fuse is internal and not field replaceable.\", u'Bosch might consider making the AC line fuse user replaceable in later production runs of this product.', u'I\\'m very pleased with this Bosch C3 Battery Charger, it\\'s not your basic car battery charger because it\\'s a \"Smart Charger\" it\\'s computer controlled meaning it adjusts to the needs of the battery that\\'s being charged.', u'You do need to select the type of battery being charged, car, motorcycle or AGM  but after that this charger takes control.', u'If the charger senses a 12 volt battery is between 8 and 10.5 volts it automatically switches to pulse charging, this allows the battery to recover the best possible way enhancing the charging process for such a low condition.', u\"This is just one of the many computer controlled advantages of this type of battery charger.I added the optional Bosch C35AC0 Quick Connect Cable Harness for C3 Battery Charger, it's a direct connect harness you can connect to your car or whatever battery that's installed.\", u\"You simply plug the charger into the end of the harness, I have one in my sports car that's stored Winters, it makes it very simple to just leave the charger connected, once the battery is fully charged the Bosch C3 charger switches over to a trickle, when I want to use the car I just unplug the harness and drive away.\", u\"I can't say enough about this great charger, buy one and you won't regret it!Update: I found that chargers made by NOCO use the same plug and make many options for connecting to different application at a lower price.\", u\"I'm guessing NOCO makes chargers for Bosch and use the same quick plugs.\", u\"For the same price as Bosch's C35ACO quick connect harness the NOCO harness includes a battery  monitorNOCO Genius GC015 12V Eyelet Battery Indicator This battery charger is so easy to use, it does almost everything except hook up the clamps!\", u'This is not your typical charger.', u'This thing is very sturdy and well built.', u\"It's compact and small, but has plenty of cord to get the job done.\", u'The small size also makes it easy to leave in your engine compartment and close your hood so no one steals it if you charge overnight.', u\"You can't do that with those big square chargers.Simply hook it up and choose your mode by pressing a single button.\", u'If your battery is near dead, it automatically detects that and begins pulse charging to get you up and running even sooner.', u'It also brings your battery up to full charge and then kicks over to trickle charge mode automatically.', u\"Sweet!The hook attachment makes it easy to simply hang from the hood latch while working, so it's out of the way.\", u\"Put the clamps on, plug it in, choose your mode, and you're charging!They also have an inexpensive harness with quick disconnect you can add to multiple cars, motorcycles, or lawnmowers.\", u'This speeds up changing the charger out even more.... and it was quick already!I highly recommend this charger.', u'Summary: Ideal for storage, the automatic modes are good for less technical people, but do limit what you can do.', u'Definitely not a \"High power\" charger.As a \"Smart\" charger, you just hook it up to the battery, plug it into the wall and push a single button - the onboard logic figures out what you need and does the rest.', u\"It will tell you if you've put the terminals on backwards, it will decide if it's a 6VV or 12V battery, and then starts to charge.\", u\"This makes it very simple, but won't let you try and resurrect 12V batteries which are below 8V.The charger itself is a nice size - fairly small and comes with a detachable plastic hook so you can hang it on your car or motorcycle when charging.\", u\"It comes with alligator clips or a direct hook up so you can use the speed connector.I wasn't able to find a current rating in the literature but looking at the back it's rated for 60 watts.\", u'This suggests that it will charge your battery at perhaps 4-5 amps.', u\"That's an overnight charge at best.\", u'When I was a kid we used to have a 20 amp charger that could bring a dead battery back to enough charge to start your car within an hour or two.', u'Other chargers have a \"start\" mode where it can jump up to 50 or more amps.', u\"If you need this capability, look atSchumacher XC103 SpeedCharge Battery Charger with Engine Startor perhapsSchumacher XC75 SpeedCharge Battery Charger with Engine StartAlthough it's listed as having four modes, I was only able to figure out 3:  1) Pulse charging (when the battery is very low, below 10.5 volts  2) Regular charging, then (3)trickle charging when it's full.Perhaps the other mode is the AGM mode - this only kicks in when it detects an AGM battery and it's very cold outside - Really kind of a limited situation.I'm using it on some 12V AGM cells right now,\"]\n"

can do a whole car in like 45 minutes.', u'BUT, it leaves the hated white residue, especially on plastics.', u\"We're it not for that, I would have given it 5 stars - like I would most any reputable wax product out there.....\", u'I remember seeing ads for this on TV since I was a kid.', u'I never believed them.', u\"I've tried other products like Mother's Gold (which is great, but required a lot more work) and Turtle Wax spray on (which does not work as well).\", u'So last weekend I had some free time and wanted to put a coat of wax on the car before winter came and did the usual damage.', u'Did one coat which took about 20-25 mins total to apply and buff off.', u'By the time I was done the sun was setting and it looked good.', u'The I woke up the next morning and wow.', u\"I'm not going to say my car looked brand new but there was a definitive glossy shine on it that I had not seen in a long time.\", u'Granted it is a bright yellow Mazda and it usually looks good, but after one coat there was a glossy clear coat finish look on it that was amazing.', u'I could see my reflection almost like looking into a mirror.', u\"With something like Mother's Gold which costs a lot more and lord does it take a lot longer and a lot more elbow grease to use, you will get a similar result.\", u'But with this, one coat, little over 20 mins and very easy on the elbow grease and I got the same result.', u\"I'm going to throw everything else out as I will never use anything else.\", u'Full disclosure I did also wash and compound the car first, but the Nu Finish really made the difference.', u'If you are going to wax your vehicle (which you should about twice a year in a cool spot in the shade) you should evaluate the clear and if it has a lot of swirl marks you should consider polishing the car and then waxing it.', u'I like to do the mothers three step process polish, micro polish, and wax but i still had some of this so i used this as step one.', u'My favorite feature is that you can apply in sunshine, although I try not to but I have a life, you know.', u\"Anyway, it protects well, lasts a very long time (I'm not sure about one year - maybe if the car is kept in a garage), and it leaves a great polished look.I suggest using a clay bar, or the likes of one, to fully clean the paint before applying Nu Finish.\", u\"You don't have to do that but I'm just stubborn like that - if you're gonna spend a lot of time doing something good you might as well go the whole nine yards.\", u\"I've used this on my cars for years, but this particular bottle was bought for polishing brass ammo cases.\", u'A little bit of this with my media gets all cases looking better than brand new.']\n"

takes just a few minutes.', u'Great product and 100% satisfied.', u'Very easy to install clean area place your guard down mark your ends and then remove tape and place very easy.', u'It would be a true five star item if the top part wrapped over the top of the sill.', u'It fits well, was easy to install and looks good.', u\"I'm not sure about the durability of it, that will only be able to be told in time  If it had wrapped over the top I've have more confidence in it lasting, as is I can see it getting peeled away by accident but only time will tell.\", u'I put these on my self (55 yr old woman) so easy to install and they look great!', u'Work great too!', u'Really should come standard on the JKU.', u\"It's a shame I had to spend extra money for something that should come standard.\", u'Looks great though and is easy to install.', u'I agree that these should come on the Jeep instead of having to pay extra for them, but with that said, installation was easy and they look good.', u\"Overall I'd buy them again.\", u\"just put it in, looks great and will take you a total of 1 minute to install...but if you have a 4 Door Wrangler don't waste your money on the 4 door version...get the 2 door..the teeny-tiny ones for the back are not even worth the time to install NICE PRODUCT DOES WHAT IS MEANT TO DO.\", u'THE TAPE SEEMS TO HOLD PRETTY GOOD ONLY TIME WILL TELL SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT ALONG TIME AGO.', u'This product is easy to install in minutes.', u'Product is durable and prevents scratching of the paint from getting in and out of my Jeep Sahara.', u'Highly recommend.', u'These are reallly nice entry guards, they look good, extremely easy to install and hopefully will keep the scuff marks of the door sills of my jeep.', u'My only wish is that they would have  been a little wider at the top to go closer to the material next to the sill-there is about a quarter to half inch exposer of the paint but they still work.', u'Great product!', u\"i HATED how every time i opened the door of my jeep i see dirt and what could possibly be scratches so i decided to buy the door sills and thank god i did first they look nice and look very OEM i don't know why jeep didn't just include them with the car but its a jeep.anyway they protect from dirt and scratches and they holding up pretty good.\", u\"they came with double sided tape which so far is strong enough to keep it in place and i have passengers stepping on it almost everyday and i don't think its going anywhere.over all i am very happy with those and i do recommend it to anyone with a jeep Easy to install, just be careful and get it right the first time because there is no 2nd time!\", u'Look great and scuff less than the plastic in the Jeep!', u'easy to install and looks good.', u'Keeps the paint intact from going in and out of the vehicle.', u'Been installed for 3 months and appears to be holding perfectly.', u'this installed in minutes and when finishes, looked like standard equipment.',

the existing trim.\", u'They serve their purpose.', u'I think they are a little expensive for such small pieces of plastic and would be happier with aluminum or steel.', u\"I'm also not a huge fan of double-sided tape as the sole attachment method.\", u'Despite those gripes, they do add a finishing touch and will protect against scrapes on the door sill.', u\"Like others, I'm not sure why these aren't installed from the factory other than a money grab.\", u'I do notice a little play once they are attached.', u'It remains to be seen how long the tape will hold them with temp changes and shoe snags.', u\"Should they peel off, I'll attack them with Gorilla Glue and clamps for a more permanent solution.\", u'Purchased these before we actually owned the 2014 Jeep Unlimited Sahara.', u'Simple install.', u'Does what it is suppose to do.', u\"Save your paint buy the door gards for your jeep the only thing I can say is make sure you clean the door jam first and make sure you have lined up and its easy if read the instruction don't just peel the cover off and try and stick it on you will miss place the guards where you want them then pull on the clear tape and the cove will come off then just push down exact fit, no issues.\", u'two sided tape holds the step units in place with no issues.', u'peel, stick, press, done.', u'These are some nice door guards.', u\"Just locate them carefully and stick them in position with the adhesive tape that's already there.\", u'they look good and are reasonably priced.', u'I have a left leg that was mangled in a car accident.', u\"Couple that with the heavy shoes and boots I have an you have loads of scuffs on the sill of the driver's door.\", u'These lovelies just curb that abuse from the minute you install them.', u\"They're also idiot proof, too.\", u'Clearly labelled and the instructions are simpler than IKEA schematics.', u'Clean application area with provided alcohol wipe, let dry and fit these into their location.', u\"Then, pull tape tab from adhesive backing, apply force and you're done.Look great, too!!!\", u'directions a little off.....needed more wipes to clean the door jams...easy to install.....these should come from the factory on every jeep...', u'These should come factory standard.', u'They look awesome installed, they give you some traction when stepping on the doors lower frame, and they keep you from uglying up the paint.', u'Couldnt be easier to put on, just rag off any mud/dust/ect from the area, use the supplied alcohol wipes to take off any oils and such from touching the area and line the piece up, pull the strip off the double stick, and press down along its length, easy peasy.', u'Easy Mounting with attached 3M tape.', u'I was a little unhappy with the one strip of tape they had on the plates so I added additional strips to make the mounting more secure.', u'The one strip they had did not hold the plate securely to the section that went up over the lip in the door so I added another strip to all the pieces to hold that section more securely to the frame and keep it from getting caught and damaged when exiting the vehicle.', u'Very good fit.They really cover the area you drag your heel over getting in and out of the jeep!Easy to install.', u'I bought and installed them when I saw the entry way getting scratched up a little from getting in and out of a jacked up JKU.', u\"I should have bought them as soon as I bought the JK As many others have stated, these should be factory installed, but for the price and ease of installation, you can't beat the value.\"]\n"

      "[u'I put a set of these in my 2006 Tacoma and they are noticeably brighter than even the Toyota factory bulbs.', u'I had extended visibility with these bulbs, and the price is right.', u\"Nice white color, no blue look to them at all, and nobody high-beams me because they are too bright to oncoming traffic.My only issue and why I gave these 4 stars instead of 5 was that the driver's side bulb went out after just less than a year, but I do a ton of off-roading on some very rough roads and that always beats up the filaments in all of my lights.\", u'For just street driving, I would expect these to last twice as long.Overall, these are great lights and I just bought another set to replace the burnt bulb and have a spare onhand.', u'I am trying these this time.', u\"I have tried the Sylvania Ultra Vision and they don't last.\", u'Maybe a year?', u'Which is unacceptible.', u'I have aftermarket headlamps in my car that have a reflector known as \"black mirrors\" basically the mirrors are tinted so the front glass is clear but it appears to be darker.', u\"The problem with the headlamps is that the bulbs I was using didn't end up projecting much light onto the road.\", u'They were too dim to drive the car at speed on backroads, even with my high beams on.I did some research around on Amazon and decided to give these bulbs a whirl.', u'What a difference!', u\"I'll definitely be sticking with these.\", u\"I wonder how much brighter they'd be with my factory headlamps -- but not enough to switch back.\", u';) They do indeed get more light out on the road compared to standard  H7.', u'Worth it, seeing is believing.', u'so far they have also held up well.', u'I got this bulb for my 2008 Hyundai Santa Fe to replace the high beams that burned out.', u'It works great.', u'They are brighter than the ones before and cheaper.', u\"I will most likely be sticking with these bulbs from now on, unless something happens to them in the near future (if it does, I'll edit this review and post it).Pros: Price, very brightCons: none so far***NOTE*** Keep in mind that these types of bulbs burn brighter than normal ones in older cars that used to last an entire year.\", u'With these types of bulbs, expect them to only last 6-9 months at the most.', u'Halogen and Xenons burn brighter...so it is kind of a cost/benefit ratio when wanting a headlight bulb.', u'A lot of negative reviewers complain that they only lasted 7 months or so, that is to be expected.', u'With better technology, comes more cost.', u'So expect them to last less than a year when getting these types of bulbs.', u'i bought 2 sets one for my ford freestar and one for my ford escape they are much brighter than the factory ones .....they are not as bright as HID bulbs but for an inexpensive street legal bulb they are an excelent choice.', u'when switching to a higher performance bulb always keep in mind they use a finer filiment and you can expect a shortened life.', u'also when replacing bulbs make sure you dont get any fingerprints on them as this causes the bulbs to run hotter reducing the life further.', u'Phillips uses a smaller capsule to raise the temperature of their filament and thus make it burn brighter, plus has a higher-pressure noble gas charge to dissuade the filament from outgassing and burning out early.', u'The end result is a bulb that lasts as long as and uses the same amount of power as what comes with most cars, but which puts out almost as much light as the 100 watt bulbs that are illegal to use on the highway and have a bad habit of melting connectors and headlight switches -- *without* the short life of the high-powered bulb, and *without* extra draw on your battery and *without* extra strain on your head light stalk switch (which is very expensive to change out if it gets melted).', u\"It's a no-brainer.\", u'If your car or motorcycle uses 9003 or H4 light bulbs -- or can be modified to use 9003 light bulbs -- buy these.', u\"You'll get more light on the road.\", u'And if your car or motorcycle uses standard round headlights or can be converted to such, add in the Hella euro-spec reflectors (which have better light control than US-spec reflectors to direct the light to where you need it rather than into the eyes of oncoming traffic) to get a lot more light on the road where you need it, rather than lighting up the tree tops like the US-spec reflectors do on high beam  (why does the NHTSA think I need to light up the tree tops?', u'Are they expecting an outbreak of vampire bats or killer owls or kamikaze squirrels or something?!).', u'I purchased the Xtreme H7 bulbs based on other reviews and I must say many of the reviews are true.', u'These bulbs are impressive maybe not 80% brighter as the package claims but they are brighter and the light much improvement over the last H7 bulbs I had.', u'With the last set of H7 bulbs I had I tried my hardest not to drive at night but I know find myself wanting to drive at night.', u'Pros:1.', u'Brighter than the OEM halogen bulb2.', u'Has lasted a yearCons:1.', u\"It isn't all that brighter than OEM halogen.\", u\"It's not anything like putting in a set of HID headlights.2.\", u'Has an average lifespan of a yearSummary:Sure, the light output was a bit more than what I was getting with the standard halogen bulbs from Sylvania.', u\"But it's not a significant increase.\", u\"Just marginal enough that you don't feel terrible about spending the extra money on these bulbs.\", u\"That being said, when my headlights burn out, I'm probably going to buy another set.\", u\"Compared to the light output on true xenon/HID bulbs, these aren't all that impressive.\", u'I replaced my stock Jeep headlights with these.', u'They seem brighter and the pattern seems better too.', u\"Some people flash their highs at me now because they assume I have my high beams on - so I know they're at least brighter because that hadn't happened with the stock headlights.\", u'These swap in just like any replacement bulbs.', u'Besides the hassle of having to remove my air intake and horn to replace them - which is very specific to a Jeep installation - they take maybe 5 minutes to remove the old ones and replace with these.', u'Make sure you DO NOT touch the bulbs with your bare hands at all.', u'If the oil from your skin gets on the glass it seriously diminishes the life of the bulb.', u'These headlights are super bright.', u'Probably the brightest that I have ever had.', u\"When I'm driving down the road with my low beams on, people are flashing me to turn my high beams off.\", u'These light up the road like no other bulb that I have ever installed.', u'Compared to the stock bulbs these are definitely an upgrade for my Jeep Liberty.', u'The bulbs shine wider on the road and are slightly brighter although not as bright as I expected.', u'I have these bulbs for my VW as well and they seem brighter, to the point where oncoming traffic are flashing their high beams at me.', u'Overall, a good bulb for the price.', u'I chose the Philips X-tremes after reading a few good reviews and after reading a lot more negative reviews on the Sylvania Ultra`s.', u'The Lamps came in a very sturdy package.', u'The light output is better than the OEM headlamps in the 2011 FJ.', u'The Philips X-tremes pattern is good with a slightly wider and longer beam.', u'It is just the right \"White\" light and not to over bearing.', u'No flashes from on coming traffic.', u'I`ll say these are worth the cost.', u'I gave them a 4 star rating bc they are a very good replacement bulb, but not the greatest, could use more side lighting.', u'I don`t know the length of service as of yet, I hope to get 1-2 years with no Day Time driving light to wear them out early.', u'So far so Good!', u'I had been researching bulbs to increase my vision at night on my cruiser motorcycle.', u'After much hunting and reading reviews, etc, I decided on these.', u'I put one into my headlamp, and WOW !!', u'!What a difference !!!', u'I love the results.', u\"I will carry the other bulb in the bike's toolbox for a spare, just in case.\", u'Purchased the bulbs to replace some dim bulbs with nearly 100k miles on them.', u'The packaging for these is very protective but was a hassle to remove the bulbs from.', u'Easy to install, fit perfectly on my vehicle.', u\"Definitely brighter, but I was replacing original factory bulbs so I can't really say whether they are brighter than new factory installed ones.\", u\"I can't comment on the life, but for the price I would definitely purchase again provided they last a decent amount of time.\", u'These light do make a difference for a 2012 Jeep Wrangler, stock light were not bright at all, I estimate that there is at least a 50% increase in brightness.', u'Well worth the expense for the upgrade!', u'This plugged right in and worked as advertised.', u\"The packaging when I received mine had &#34;9008 xps2&#34; vs &#34;9008 H13&#34; as shown in the circle, so don't worry if that happens to you.\", u'The end result was a very much more white light vs the factory yellow/orange.', u'The distance it goes out is about the same as the factory.', u'The fill out to the sides and near the front of the Jeep is better.', u\"It's not holy crap better, but a bit better.\", u\"Now I don't feel the need to run my fog lights all the time.\", u'I think the brights are no better than the low beams on these really.', u'I got mine with a rebate for about $20.', u\"In theory because they are burning brighter they will burn out faster.TIPSDon't touch the bulb when installing.\", u\"Maybe I'm biased because the Toyota FJ Cruiser seems to come with the most anemic headlights ever made... but these Philips were a marked increase in brightness for me.\", u\"I'm very satisfied.\", u'Still have not blown out on me as other people keep saying.', u\"I can't help but wonder if they know not to touch the bulb itself.\", u'It can be difficult to see improvement in a headlight on any regular night but I have found on wet and rainy nights these bulbs make a huge difference.', u'I have a 2001 prius c dim lights.', u'I used a cleaner on the plastic and it was brighter.', u'I tried these headlights cause of the ratings.', u'I put only one in for now and was trying to compare in the dark.', u'the package says its 80% brighter, I dont think so.', u'More like 25% brighter and a little wider.', u'I really want to know how long these will last, some have said one year, I hope so.', u'Ive had them for a couple of months and they are better than the old ones, the price was not bad on amazon too!', u'No complaints.', u\"I previously had the Sylvania's in there and I don't know if it's because they lost power over time but I don't have the issue of low light on those dark stormy nights.\", u'I had some other bulbs in the car before that I thought was pretty bright but then I tried these based on reviews and price, and all I have to say is that I am amazed at the distance these light bulbs project to!', u'I feel much safer driving at night because I can see a lot further and the angle is much wider.', u'So worth the money!', u'**UPDATE I recently installed a set of these on a 2002 Subaru Forester.', u'They are much brighter than OEM and other replacement bulbs as my previous review states on the other vehicles I have used these with.', u'HOWEVER the DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS NO LONGER FUNCTION by automatically turning on the low beam headlights when the car is turned on.', u'To me this is not a problem, if one wants to drive during the day with their headlights on they can do so by simply turning them on manually.', u'Just note that this may occur if you car is equipped with daytime running lamps.', u'Personally I prefer them as is and like the complete control of when my headlights are on or off and think exchanging FAR brighter bulbs for them being on automatically during the day is more than worth it, and again the price here on Amazon was much cheaper than in the stores, still think these are the best halogen bulb replacement deal out there.', u'Fast and easy way to make your headlights brighter.', u\"**Yes these bulbs are about as good as you are going to get with your stock headlights, they have a noticeable improvement in brightness over the stock bulbs, but don't expect too much.\", u'These bulbs have made the biggest improvement over stock among the various similar bulbs of which I have tried.', u'I like them a bit better than the Silver Stars for example.', u'The price here was very good and they basically did about what they were advertised to do.', u'I would recommend them.', u'However these or any other bulbs may not be enough if you have other issues such as the clouded headlight lenses.', u'These are good halogen bulb replacements, they will be brighter than stock but not without clear lenses and not turn them in to HID brightness levels.', u'If you have old clouded lenses as well then using a headlight restoration kit will help a lot as well.', u'I used these bulbs along with one of the Maguires headlight restoration kit with the Plastic X compound.', u'My mothers 98 Toyota Camry had very weak headlights and I noticed the clouded lenses and purchased these bulbs to try to give her the best vision for night driving I could.', u'Especially important if one does not have the best night vision to begin with.', u'So that gave her clear lenses again which was needed for any new bulb to work better.', u'This is about as good as one is going to get with a halogen bulb upgrade from all of those I have tried to date and they are very easy to install.', u'So a good improvement for the money as they are easy to change and inexpensive.It is easy to see the difference in brightness with these bulbs.', u'Just change one out and turn your headlight on shining on your garage door for example.', u'It should be obvious they are both brighter and whiter.', u'The easiest and cheapest way to make  your stock headlights brighter.', u'While I keep the bulbs I have replaced in the vehicle just in case one is needed in an emergency I have yet to have one of these bulbs burn out prematurely.', u'I have had them in one vehicle for 2 years and still working.', u'For about 25 bucks they are both a good deal and better than found at the local parts stores.If they are not bright enough for you just do not make the mistake of going to a plug and play type HID kit...See Below about that.The only real way to get an incredible improvement (3-4 times brighter) from your stock headlight housings is to do a PROPER HID retrofit.', u'But as for HID I want to make it clear that they are great and will be about 3- 4 times brighter than stock for sure and use less wattage as almost all run at 35 watts.', u'BEWARE if you are going to go with HID\\'s one should NOT buy an inexpensive \"Plug and Play\" kit that uses ballasts and HID bulbs that you stick in your stock halogen headlight housing.', u'Doing so will cause the huge increase in brightness with no control of the beam pattern and while also illegal almost everywhere more importantly they will blind oncoming traffic and are a hazard will likely burn your reflectors in your headlight housings and are just a horrible thing to do period, no exceptions.', u'HOWEVER there is a CORRECT way to upgrade to HID headlights which is known as \"retrofitting\" which means that you install projectors designed for HID bulbs.', u'This is a great improvement and they have cutoff shields built in to the projectors so there is a very controlled but wide and bright low beam and super good high beam output.', u'Doing this requires opening up the actual headlight housing and installing the new projectors and mounting the ballasts and new wiring harness.', u'There is a place that sells these sort of kits for retrofitting and web sites dedicated to this subject.', u'It is far from just plugging in a new bulb such as this so it takes a bit of effort or paying a shop that does HID retrofits to do this for you.', u'Just a warning to those that think the cheap HID kits everywhere are not an option to even consider.', u'Get the best halogen bulbs you can find or do a full HID retrofit.', u'Don\\'t make the mistake that just using a HID plug and play kit such as is commonly sold here and other places is a \"middle of the road option\".', u'It is most likely illegal and never a good idea no matter how enticing the cheap prices seem.Use these halogen upgrade bulbs and if that is not enough for you then go all the way.', u'There are just way too many that go for these plug and play kits that are illegal and cause accidents that I want the message out that they should not be considered which many that are looking for brighter headlights such as those purchasing these bulbs could potentially consider.', u'If interested in HID try a web site forum like the HID planet for advice.', u'Nice white light, a little brighter than a \"regular\" bulb.', u'It helps me spot El Chupacabra that has been spotted in the area recently and a nice unpromoted feature of these lights is the color balance of these lights are specifically made to fend off vampires.', u'I had the chance to try it out the other night on my way home from my competitive bread making club and they worked great.', u'After doing alot of research on aftermarket light bulbs for my late-model vehicles, I decided to go with these.', u\"And i'm glad I did!!!\", u'First of all, I think the wavelength of the Silverstar lights is inefficient and obnoxious to say the least.', u\"I've utilized silverstars in the past with less than pleasant results, often hindering my driving ability in everything but clear weather.\", u'This is not the case with the Philips bulbs tho.', u\"While I wasn't blown away by the brightness of these lamps (as other reviewers have noted), the lights pattern is MUCH more effective than stock lamps.\", u'These bulbs also retain the OEM yellow/incandescent color, thus matching any stock fog light bulbs you might have on your vehicle.', u'This simple fact keeps the vehicle appearance clean as opposed to having different color/intensity sets of bulbs.', u'Good stuff... Nice bright white light.', u\"I hope they last more than one year, but let's see what happens.\", u'Consumer reports say these brighter halogens are basically just whiter lights, not much brighter anyway.', u'But I got it for 20 bucks if my rebate check ever comes in.', u'But you can buy regular phillps for 12 bucks a pair and they will last at least a few years, but I personally like the whiter light.']\n"

      "[u'I have been using this brand of wax for about 3 years.', u'I chose it after a user on a well known car care forum did a experiment where by he divided up the hood of his car into 4 quadrants and applied a different wax to each.', u'He used 476S, Chemical Guys Petes 5050 and two other products - one may have been Finish Care 1000..not sure.', u'He tracked the longevity of each over nearly a year, documenting the performance with pictures.', u'All lasted a very long time but Petes and 476 appeared to last the longest by good margin.', u'This stuff does not come in a fancy can...looks like it was packaged in the 60s.', u\"Doesn't matter.\", u'It is a great wax.', u'Given the price and how it performs, it is the best value on the market.', u\"It is not a Carnuba based product but again doesn't matter.\", u'It gives off a shine that is just as good as the finest carnuba waxes which cost 3X as much.', u'By the way, I have used 476S on furniture and other objects and surfaces around the house.', u\"I don't believe that this stuff will stain trim if it gets on it by accident.\", u'Ive applied this wax to 2 vehicles so far.', u'The wax had proven to maintain it beading ability through several rain storms and washes.', u'Apply your first coat then let cure for +12hrs before applying a second coat.', u'Very economical too because it spreads nicely and goes a long way when used with a DA polisher and finishing pad.', u'The luster/shine is not as nice as Megs NXT, but this was expected and the durability outweighs the less shine.', u'It still shines great though.', u\"This car wax is the most durable I've used, leaves a great shine and really protects against rain and the environment.\", u'The only thing that we use in small sections at a time, because if left to dry for more than 2 or 3 minutes will cost to remove.', u'I personally let it dry for a minute as Central American climate is warm, it rains half the year, for that reason I use it because it lasts for longer during the long rains.', u'aproximadamnete lasts 6 to 8 weeks.', u'the mother and other brands like Meguiar not work during the winter, rain in one week both the mother and the Meguiar fail, Very quickly delivered, easy to apply and remove.', u'Leaves a very nice shine.', u'Requires a bit of elbow grease but the pain is worth the gain.', u'Would recommend to anyone.', u'I have tried many well known waxes out there but even with zaino z2 pro, after couple rain storms, the finish became dull and sticky, i used my finger to wipe.', u'With collinite 476, after 5 storms 2 car washes and 2 months baking in the sun, the finish still feel extremely smooth.', u'Notice this wax wont give u deep finish looking like those carnauba but it will bright up your finish like glass, it almost hurt my eyes looking directly to the car under the sun lol.', u'I would recommend this for whose who have brighter color car and #915 for darker color.', u'I have polished metal color.I highly doubt this wax will let go of my car anytime soon ...', u'I had used this product before and was looking to purchase more.', u'It is not available where I live so I had to order it online.', u'This wax is a paste and is easy to apply with a slightly damp cloth or applicator.', u'I am currently using it on my boat and cars.', u'I would suggest working a smaller area to avoid the wax drying and becoming harder to remove.', u'If you stay in a 2x2 or so section it is easy to put on and take off.', u'It leaves a very slick surface and a good shine.', u'If you use a carwash soap for cleaning, the wax will remain for quite some time.', u'I have noticed it seems to hold up well on the boat in saltwater as well.', u'That says a lot for anything in the Florida sun.', u'This product which is geared more towards the enthusiast rather than the everyday user.', u'Collinite 476s says it has no cleaners and no fillers.I do not detail professionally, but I do own much of the equipment pros use and can put out a finished product that might look as it came from a professional.', u'I have been using Collinite 476s for the past year.Out of the box, Collinite 476s says it has no cleaners and no fillers.', u'476s comes packaged in an \"old style\" tin, which you need to open with a screw driver.', u'Inside you\\'ll find 476s is a \"paste wax\" with a typically stiff consistency, notably, 476s smells quite bad compared to most new waxes.', u'It almost smells like it has a petroleum base, compared to the fruity scents of many newcomers.The test subject is a 2003 Silverado.', u\"The truck finish is good, the paint was first clayed then it was polished using Meguiar's M-205.\", u'Reason is having a clayed and polished paint finished will make sure the wax is working on a clean and even surface.', u'I then examined the paint and found it to be free of any defects.Collinite application.', u'Typical hand application, with a foam applicator pad.', u'Right off the bat, I noticed Collinite was more difficult to apply then a typical liquid wax.I applied it to every panel on the truck.', u'As soon as I was finished applying the last panel I noticed the wax has a nice haze, dry but not chaulky.', u'I then got a fresh clean microfiber towel.', u'I fold the towel into 4 even sqaures.', u\"Removal was not terribly difficult, but not the easiest wax I've removed either.\", u'I examined the car and it looked fantastic.', u'After 12 hours, I put a second coat of 476s on the truck.', u'Conventional detailing wisdom says you need to give a wax 12 hours for it to \"set up\" and \"cure\" on the paint.', u'The second layer was applied the following morning.Overall, I think Collinite is a very good product.', u'I think it lasts longer than the typical wax and even longer than most sealants.', u'I think it looks quite good on a properly prepared vehicle but might not be the best for your average Joe wanting to wax his car.The point being, Collinite is a pretty durable wax, but it is not the magic bullet the manufacturer makes it out to be (no LSP is).', u\"Under the right conditions (garage queen), you can probably get 4-6 months out of this product, but you'll NEVER get 1 year if it is left out to the elements.\", u'I have gone through over 70 types of waxes and by far Collinite #476 is the best.', u'I have spent over $100 on some waxes and giving a product to product comparison I should have just spent money buying dozens of this product.', u'This wax can withstand several washes and I should know since I wash and detail my personal cars every week and it still continues to bead water.', u'The 476 features carnauba wax AND normal wax together with some polymers to mall all work together.', u\"It's a really nice starters kit for a good wax layer that you can wait around 48h to have a second one applied.Collinite is not a very famous brand such as Meguiar's or 3M (actually the same since 2012) but they make awesome products.\", u\"Don't be fooled by the advertisement, if you do a research you'll find this is a GREAT quality and really good price.\", u'Probably the liquid version is easier for most people.The 476 is perfect for any color car same quality as the 915 (higher in carnauba, better for dark cars).', u'Really good product!GO FOR IT']\n"

u'The lights all function as I hoped and it truly was &#34;plug and play&#34;.', u\"I haven't taken them through a real rainy season yet, but the extra brightness (read:SAFETY) is a must have especially since we lug our kids around all the time.I deducted a star because of the shipping waste/hassle.\", u'I had to pick this up from my local post office because they could not fit the package in a regular truck.', u\"The shipment packaging was exceedingly oversized given the length of the actual product's packaging.\", u'When this arrived, it was in a long, tall box that, once opened, seemed to contain a roll of wrapping paper.', u'&#34;What the heck is this?&#34; I wondered.', u'Then I remembered that I ordered the Putco 90009-60 Tailgate Light Bar with Turn Signal Function from Amazon.This is long - very long -designed for a 60 inch tailgate.', u\"Frankly, it's too big to have any use for me, so I passed it on to a nephew who owns a truck for his business that keeps him on the road a lot.\", u'He installed it and had no complaints.', u'This is very bright and serves its purpose exceptionally well.', u\"The price tag is understandable since this is a quality product, much better than most of what's out there.\", u'This Putco 90009-60 LED Tailgate Light Bar with Turn Signal is easy to install if you have a tow package & a place to plug it in.', u\"If you don't have a plug in and no automotive knowledge, the light bar may be a little more difficult to install.I installed the light bar using the enclosed 2-sided tape (did not want to drill holes into my tailgate).\", u'So far, after approximately 200 miles, the light bar is still securely fastened to the tailgate.The LED light is bright, and is bright enough so that you can see it in the daylight.', u'The turn signal function is nice and works well with no additional installation requirements.', u'With the plug in, the turn signal, brake lights & running lights work automatically,  I will have splice the reverse lights in, and I have yet to do that.Overall, I am happy with the light bar and believe that it really helps others see my truck (especially when fully loaded & the cab light is covered).', u'My husband loved this new tailgate light bar.', u'He installed it on our sons red truck and it looks awesome.', u'My husband said the key to secure installation is to wash area with soap and water and dry, then clean with plain rubbing alcohol.', u'This prepares the area clean for the secure application of the sticky tape.It looks like it came on the truck.', u'The light is really bright and and can easily be seen in daylight.Great for drawing attention to the back of the truck and hopefully will prevent another rear end collision.', u'This is a very good LED Light Bar that works very well.', u\"I installed it on my 2007 Dodge Ram 1500, just above my bumper so it isn't very visible in day light until it come on.\", u'The lights are bright even in the day, and very bright at night, adding more safety to my truck.', u'My only complaint is with the instruction sheet, which indicates to install the light with the wires on the right side as in the picture.', u'I installed it like indicated and plugged it into my trailer wiring plug.', u'When I tested the lights the turn signal activated the wrong side, so I had to remove the light bar and reinstall it in the opposite direction.', u'The good thing was I had installed it using the included brackets instead of the double sided tape.', u'I highly recommend you plug it in to test it BEFORE you install it to your vehicle, especially if you plan to use the double sided tape.', u'Other than the poor instruction sheet, this would have rated 5 stars.', u'I also like the lifetime warranty on this item.', u\"I'm not too fond of the mounting options -- either double sided tape or drilling screws through the body of my car.\", u'Tape will just fall off after a car wash or two.', u'And screws would cause the body to rust at the puncture points.', u\"I'd prefer some sort of clip-on option.\", u'Aside from that, this works quite well.', u'Setup is very easy, so long as you have the proper wiring.', u\"If not, it'll take a little more work, but still pretty easy.\", u'The LEDs are bright, but not blinding.', u'Like how each side flashes with each respective turn signal.', u'A bit long for my purposes, but workable.', u\"But I'm tweaking my own mounting solution.\", u'A little overpriced, but good overall.', u'Simple plug in hookup  for most modern vehicles with a trailer hitch set up.', u'Color coded instructions if you must wire directly.', u'Bright and  very cool looking on your vehicle.', u'Recommend doing a preview  test before permanent attaching, to make sure you have it turned the correct way etc.', u'Comes with double sided tape or brackets for permanent attachment, you will also need a drill for the bracket attachment method.', u'Works with Brakes, Running Lights, Reverse Lights & Signals.', u'Installed easily, looks great.', u'Product quality is rather high.', u'Instructions and the double sided tape that was provided were on the weak side though (-1 star).', u'I trusted the provided instructions but once the bar was on the truck I discovered the left and right functions were actually the reverse of what appears to be written.', u\"It also appears they've done a good job with the silicone to seal up the hole(s) where the wires come through the body of the light bar.\", u\"Here's some tips and other info...1) forget the tape provided and get some3M Double sided tape.\", u'You will want to verify the turn signal directions prior to mounting with this tape.', u'Pretty difficult to remove after using this tape.', u'***UPDATE*** Forget tape at all and use the plastic mounts.', u'Yeah you have to drill but way more reliable.2) Use dielectric grease on the 4 pin connectors3) Some people frown onScotchlok tapsbut I like them.', u'It made tapping the reverse wire very easy.', u\"Then some liquid electrical tape and it's all set.4) On my 2005 Dodge Ram 2500 Diesel the reverse wire was the white with green stripe in the wire loom connecting to the 7 pin trailer plug.\", u'This will of course vary by model.', u'I got this installed at my local workshop when I went for the inspection and liking it so far.When I compare the price on amazon for other products, this seems pretty expensive, but looking at the quality of the weather sealing, connectors and the brightness of the light - it does deserve the premium.']\n"

are made to \"hug\" the windshield and not allow debris, weather elements such as rain, snow or ice interfere with its smooth, streak-free and quiet wipes.', u'They offer a more lower profile and the springs are completely concealed, so no more leafs getting stuck in your wipers.They are aerodynamic so that means less wind lift and they actually use the wind to increase the downward pressure and contact on your windshield.', u'Once you try a Beam blade wiper like the Bosch Clear Advantage, you will never go back to a conventional wiper again.', u'About a week after picking up these Bosch

were a perfect fit on our 2003 Ford F-150.They've done a great job of wiping away the rain, sleet and slushy snow we've had so far this year.\", u'They go on easily and are a great fit.', u'Keep in mind that there is only 1 wiper blade in each package, so if your vehicle requires two blades of the same size, you will need to order 2 of these.', u\"Fortunately Amazon offers a Part Finder tool for

money.', u\"Only negative I can give is it doesn't have the cover to hides the attachment to the wiper arm, but that's just cosmetic and so far it clears my windshield in one-swipe... only time will tell if they last as long as the Icon version.\", u'Would highly recommend especially for MDX car people, its fits, works and looks like the OEM wiper blades that came with the car.', u'Installation is easy.', u'Would highly recommend again, as I said before.', u'These single point attachment blades are great, forget the cheap ones that have several attachment points, those eventually streak.', u'These have constant pressure over the whole blade.', u'I love them.', u\"I didn't like my previous Bosch Icon blades.\", u'They always seemed to streak.', u\"Switching it out with this cheaper blade, so far this one seems to be working much better, plus it's cheaper.\", u'The connectors on the Icon seem a bit nicer, but the clear advantage went on very easily and still seems as secure as any other blade.', u'Hopefully the performance of this blade will hold up better than the Icon did.', u\"these seem to work well, but we'll have to see about longevity.\", u\"they don't have the metal

wipers of choice has been Bosch Micro Edge.', u'I have found that the Bosch Clear Advantage Beam wiper blades to be superior to those wipers.', u'They fit perfectly on my 2012 Infiniti G37.', u'They also do an excellent job clearing the windshield.', u'This Bosch 17-CA Clear Advantage Wiper Blade works very well on the passenger side of my 2000 Chevy Caviler.', u'This was my first time personally replacing wiper blades on this car but it was a very quick and painless process.Once installed, the wiper blade did a great job keeping the window clear in the very heavy rain we had the day after I put them on.', u'Since I only put the new blade on the passenger side, it was clear that this is works better than the 4 month old one on the driver side (not sure of the brand Jiffy-Lube put on it) so I will by buying theBosch 22-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade - 22\"to even it up.Recommended!CFH I have to admit it is hard for me to get excited about any product having to do with my car.', u'But, this wiper works just like it should.', u'It installs easily and works like a charm in rain.', u\"It hasn't snowed yet, but it works very well in the rain.\", u'There is nothing wrong with this product.', u'It is overpriced so I took off one star.Installation is as expected DifferentThe Bosch wiper blades use the new design that is replacing the old one.', u'The wiper arm and blade are one piece.', u'Bosch uses a bracketless wiper design, and other manufacturers are doing the same.', u'The arm has a built-in spring and also a flat rubber blade attached as one piece.', u\"The arm is curved to distribute tension evenly so it gets the whole middle of the windshield just as well as it clears the area above the pivot.Advantages*The wipe is smooth, especially compared against the other comparably-priced wipers in the category like the ones I've got in the past.\", u\"*It's got a new kind of fastening mechanism that more easily clips on and off.\", u'The goodness of this is ease of changing blades more frequently.', u\"*Supposed to be 40% longer-lasting, since it's got almost no moving parts unlike standard blade arms.\", u'*Supposed to be quite - although I didn\\'t notice significant noise difference.Reasons not to get this wiper blade*If it\\'s worth spending a little more to get the Bosch Icon blades, which use two types of rubber (\"dual rubber process\"- hard rubber for wiping and soft rubber for flexing).', u'*If the purpose includes frequent off-road heavy duty including for mud.Summary: The blade design is excellent.', u'The blades have good value and are easy to change.', u'When I first looked up the size for my Saturn SL2, I found that the chart said a 20 inch size would work well for the passenger side.', u'When I went to the Bosch site, I found that it was recommended to get the 21 inch and I got upset.', u'I had already ordered the 20 inch size.The great news is that the wiper already on my car was 20 inches and this one fits and works beautifully.', u'The 21 inch would be too big anyway.', u'It was tricky to install at first, and despite being plastic in construction, it goes on well and so far has stayed on securely even in high wind.The wiper itself is a huge improvement over the other wipers that I have had, including Anco.', u'What I love about this wiper is that it hugs the windshield, but it also moves easily across the glass when there is barely any water on the window, or if the window is covered.The windshield is left very clear and easy to see through with no streaks or spots left uncleared in heavy and light rain.', u'I have not had any snow to evaluate winter performance yet.', u'I will update when I do.What I love most about these wipers is that they are SILENT.', u'No more squeaky wipers!', u'Everyone that has come in my car has remarked- \"Those wipers are completely SILENT!', u'WHERE DID YOU GET THEM?', u'\"I have to say they are the first wipers I have ever had which truly are silent so far after a few weeks of using them.', u'So far they are my favorite wiper!', u\"I've been using Bosch wipers for many years, and have been especially pleased with their ICON blade.\", u\"It clears the windshield very well with no streaks, and does so with far less noise than any of the OEM blades I've had on my cars.While this new blade (Clear Advantage) is also excellent when it comes to clearing the windshield without any streaking, and it was very easy to install on my Infiniti EX.\", u'However, it makes more noise than the ICON.', u'Rather than a hushed \"wisp-wisp\" sound, I get a small amount of chatter at the peak of the stroke.', u\"Not enough to be irritating, but certainly more than the ICON.I'll continue to use these, but will be replacing them with some ICONs when their useful life is over or if the chattering gets louder.\", u'While the ICONs are a bit more expensive, I think they are a better blade.', u'Very good quality blades.', u'Perfect for my 2003 Toyota corolla.', u\"Works as described... there's nothing better.\", u'Recommended to anyone that will love to try it I replaced the worn out Bosch Icon Wiper Blades on my 2003 Dodge Ram 1500 with a new set of Bosch Clear Advantage Blades.', u'The first thing that noticed is how similar they are to my last set of Icon blades.', u'The Clear Advantage blades are almost identical to the Icon blades.', u'The only major difference is that the Icon blades have a cover that closes and covers the top part where they hook on to the arm.', u\"The Clear Advantage blades don't have the same cover and it's open so snow and ice can get in it and freeze.\", u\"When I compare how well both blades work I can't tell any difference at all.\", u'The Clear Advantage blades work well in the rain but struggle when it comes to snow, sleet and ice.', u'I had the same results with my last blades.', u\"These wiper blades are just fine during Spring, Summer and Fall but I wouldn't recommend them for winter.\", u'They like to streak and not provide a very clean window surface for viewing when it comes to sleet or icy conditions.', u'Overall I like these blades because they work well most of the year and they are very priced reasonable.', u\"I don't really see any real advantage to getting the Icon Blades over the Clear Advantage blades so if trying to pick between the two I would go with these.\", u'Wipes clean and true; no squeak, chatter, or smear.', u'The curve on the blade is strong, much better than the old style multi-hinged metal blade holder that came on the vehicle.', u'The pressure is applied evenly across the entire blade as it form fits the shape of the windshield.', u'With this blade you can update your vehicle with the latest blade technology that you see on the new cars.', u'Bosch claims most wiper blades should be changed every 6 months but these will last a year.', u'I have never changed mine more often than 1 year intervals, maybe these will last longer?Installation was super easy, no adapter to change out, just remove the old wiper by pressing one clip and then installing this blade.', u'Easy installation and good wiping.', u'No complaints thus far.', u'Will update in a few months to report on how it held up.', u'These are great wipers.', u\"Easy to install and provides a clear windshield during bad weather.To me, it's just easier to replace the whole wiper than just to replace the blades.\", u\"I don't have to worry about them coming back off.These are good quality and I'm pleased with them.\", u'I use these on the driver side of a 99 Pathfinder.', u'They were easy to install and work great.', u'We had a lot of rain and these wipers never gave me any trouble.', u'I was able to drive safely in the rain without my visibility being compromised.', u'It also helped clear the light snow I had just fine.', u'I highly recommend these for your vehicle.', u'I love Bosch wiper blades.', u'The installation is always quick and simple, and the quality of the blade is incredible.', u'These blades do a great job of wiping the windshield without leaving streaks.', u\"They're not too noisy either.I've been using Bosch blades on my pickup truck for a couple years now.\", u\"Replacing the blades on my wife's car with Bosch blades was a no-brainer for me.\", u'I really like to wait a full season before I review these, but for a month they have been perfect.', u'Good price to.', u'These wipers work great but I should have gotten one 21 instead of 20 for the driver side of the 1999 Durango thus allowing more access to area coverage on the windshield.', u\"The driver's side windshield wiper on our family vehicle was starting to tear apart at the edges so I was happy to try these sample Bosch Clear Advantage Beam Blades.\", u\"Last week there were brief but heavy rain showers that allowed me to test new and old style blades side by side.Advantages I've noticed over old style wipers:>Less moving parts than old style metal framed blades.>Spring mechanism is the flexible beam itself rather than old exposed metal springs.>Lower profile for a less obtrusive, more modern appearance, also less likely to get damaged.>Uniform contact points conforms to highly curved windshields for more even wiping/cleaning.>Lighter and appears more durable.\", u'Old metal wiper frames tend to fade over time and the rubber blades tear away from the wiper assemblies.>Beam frame designed to create down force on wipers at highway speeds; stable, effortless clearing of windshield.>Lower noise and streaking so far.Overall:A design advancement if wiper design that provides superior performance, safety, and durability over old wiper designs.', u'Costs about double that of old design wiper blades.', u'Good deal if these new Beam Blades last twice as long as old blades.', u'I installed this on the passenger side of my truck luckily 1 day before a week of torrential and much needed storms.', u'I can\\'t give 5 stars because I don\\'t feel there was any markedly significant improvement over my 2 year old wiper on the driver side.What I can say, is that this wiper is cleaner-appearing in that the \"wiper body\" is simple; it doesn\\'t have the exoskeleton frame around it that your typical windshield wiper does.', u'It seems to rely on some curvature to keep it flat on your windshield.', u'Only time will tell if this curvature is maintained or if the \"exoskeleton frame\" on typical wipers is there for a reason and we shouldn\\'t fix what is broken.Now, one improvement I have noticed that this wiper does NOT have and that\\'s the inclusion of an aero-foil so that at highway speeds, the wiper actually stays on the windshield glass.', u'I have that on my weekend car and I have noticed a markedly signficiant improvement, the aero-foil really does keep the wiper on the windshield glass.I suppose if Bosch can keep the simple, cleaner-appearing non-wiper body plus adding a sleek aero foil, then at that time, it might be a 5-star wiper.', u'For now, this model is 4 stars.', u'I use Michelin wiper for the driver side and Bosh for the passenger.', u'After 2 months of heavy use this one doing well (almost no stripes).', u\"After a cold winter with lots of ice on a windshield every day I'd expect the rubber blade to deform and it did a little bit on Bosch.\", u'Good product for the money.', u'Windshield wipers need to work well when you need them.', u'These wiper blades fit that bill.', u'At least so far.', u'They clean the windshield very well, in a variety of conditions.', u\"And they look like they are built well, so they will last.Too bad I can't tell you now how well these wiper blades work in a year or two.\", u\"According to the experts, pretty much all wiper blades -- cheap or expensive -- clean windshields well for that long, but no longer.Given that, these wiper blades seem reasonably priced -- not the cheapest you'll find, but not too expensive either.\", u'The 24-inch blade we needed for the other side of our windshield cost a little more, about $15, so the set was about $30 in total.', u\"Shopping around, that's not bad.\", u'These are GREAT windshield wipers.', u'After trying it out I bought them for all my cars.', u'Easy to install and work great.', u\"My only complaint about Bosch is that they have a confusing product line and it's not clear which wipers to use.\", u'Bosch Clear advantage Beam  wiper Blade is an excellent product It excells in heavy wind and rain.', u'I love it !', u'Also it is not noisey like my old blades.They are very easy to install.', u'And  No annoying squeeks.', u'I wish I had gotten them sooner !!', u\"I've put these to use recently in rainy Florida weather and they get the thumbs up from me.\", u'My windshield cleared without streaking, and they seem like they will hold up for a long time.', u'These are very well made, and worth the small extra cost because I believe these are more durable and long lasting than the cheaper options.', u'Bought this as a replacement for the drivers side of a 2013 Hyundai Sonata.', u'The wipers work great and much better than the OEM ones (which were thinner, did not last a year, and the plastic piece on top broke off).', u'Installation was a breeze once I figured out how to unlatch it.', u\"Couldn't be happier.\", u'Oh and they are much sportier looking for sure :) Bosch Clear Advantage Wiper Blade 20\"These are your typical graphite-coated rubber blades with an aerodynamic body.', u\"I've used Pylon, Michelin, and Anco aerodynamic wiper blades in the past and generally speaking, they all worked flawlessly for the first year.\", u'Then, the spring pressure gets weak and they begin to either chatter or streak.', u\"I've found from experience that replacing blades every 1-2 years is a good idea to prevent problems in the winter when the blade rubber tends to get stiff.These Bosch blades work great so far, but wiper blades generally don't show problems until later in their life.\", u'The installation was simple, as they just clipped into the arms on the car.Overall: 5/5 stars, works great so far - no noise or streaking.', u'But I will need to do longer-term testing to see if they last more than 1-2 years.', u'Most of the aerodynamic wiper blades work fine for the first year and then show the typical chatter/streak issues common even with the less expensive blades.', u'Works great and I discovered these to be a better replacement than the upscale BOSCH wipers.', u'You can save about $10 on each by sticking to these.', u'Amazon had these on a special deal, 2 for $20.', u'I bought a pair and after receiving them I ordered two more pairs.', u'These wipe the windshield like a high dollar squeegee.', u\"I just hope they can withstand the Florida sun for a whole season.UPDATE: November 13, 2013: After an entire summer in the Florida sun I replaced these wipers with the same type I'd stocked up when they were on sale.\", u'I think they performed well.', u'The Florida sun in Summer and early Fall is brutal.', u'Ultraviolet degradation is not uncommon.', u'The high quality of these wipers was apparent in the fact that they lasted all season plus a few more months.', u\"New pair now installed, hopefully they'll make it through until Springtime 2014.\", u'These are great wipers and go on in a snap!', u'Very good workmanship and great in the rain!', u'Love the spineless design!', u'When I bought my new wipers, I wanted the best of the best, so I chose these, which had the best reviews on Amazon.', u\"They're good - but they're not the incredible wiper I was looking for.\", u'I had Neoforms on my old car, and those were fantastic - they never left a single streak.', u\"The Bosch, on my new car, don't fare quite as well, but they do a pretty good job.I'm probably going to try out another set of Neoforms on this car later, so that I can make a true apples-to-apples comparison, and I'll update my review once I do.\", u\"For now, these are good enough, but if you're looking for the 'ultimate' wiper, you'll probably want to keep looking.\", u'I already had a similar style windshield wiper by another brand.', u'One of the blades became slightly warped over time and would leave a small section untouched when it was on.', u'We therefore decided to replace it with one of the Bosch blades before the rain season begins.This Bosch one seems to be slightly lighter than the other blade.', u'I put it on the drivers side of my Mazda Miata.', u'It was very easy to attach, no fancy hinged locking parts to navigate and press down.', u'They just slide on and snap right into place.I park on the street and often get dust and pollen on the windshield in the morning and, as autumn creeps closer, the window fogs up on the outside in the morning.', u\"This makes visibility poor in the bright early morning sunlight if the windshield isn't swept thoroughly.\", u'This blade did a great job with the morning windshield and I feel much safer taking off for work in the morning.', u'It clears all the dust and pollen no problem too, leaving the windscreen free of water and easy to see through.', u\"That's important as I live in a part of town filled with trees and, in my experience, rain was actually easier for windshield wipers to deal with than dirt and pollen.So I like these blades.\", u\"They do their job well and I'm optimistic they will work well throughout the winter.\", u'And the price seems quite reasonable.', u'I recommend them.', u'I have been using a jointless wiper blade ever since it became a popular replacement for the factory jointed type that is usually pre-installed when you buy a new vehicle.', u'The Bosch 19-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade fits the bills when you need to replace or just want to upgrade to a better performing wiper blade.', u'There was no rain yet in my little corner of the country when I got this wiper so to be able to give a comprehensive review, I have to \"simulate\" rain-like conditions by turning a hose with a shower nozzle on the windshield in the driveway of my garage.', u'Snow on the other hand is a different story, no way for me to simulate that kind of weather event.My thoughts:Performance: the jointless type Bosch 19-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade is contoured better to \"hug\" your windshield with minimal resistance and pressure points.', u'This translates to better wiping ability thereby enabling you to see better in inclement weather.', u'Since it is jointless, this type of wiper gives you uniform wiping pressure, eliminating the pressure points or the \"streaks\" that you see across your windshield as it moves across the windshield.', u'The curvature of this wiper is aerodynamic, it will prevent a lift-off of the blade even in high winds.Installation: it took less than 10 minutes to install the Bosch 19-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade without using any of the adapters for my wiper arm.Very satisfied with how the Bosch 19-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade has performed.', u'It is cheaper compared to other jointless name-brand wiper but gives the same amount of effect.', u'Highly recommended!', u'We liked these enough we already bought more for the other car.', u'They are easy to install, are rubber, which I find last longer.', u'The whole blade is springy and coated, all other wipers i have owned are exposed metal.', u'So far so good, we had some rain and they do a great job, quiet and streak free.', u'will update when it snows.update 4/13 These did well all winter and still look ok and intact, working good after 6 months.', u'I like the design of this wiper blade.', u'I have had them installed on my 2005 Hyundai Elantra for a few months now and I really like how the bracketless design does not leave streaks.', u'The only downside is that these get dirtier faster and need to be cleaned a little more frequently than traditional wiper blades but nonetheless they work really well.', u\"Okay, first I must confess...I'm not a car crazy type of person.\", u'I view driving as more or less a necessary evil and tend to think of transportation as a function rather than extension of my personality...much to the distress of my dear spouse.So, it should come as no surprise that car maintenance is also not at the top of my list.', u'I try to take care of oil changes etc but other than that...give little though to something until it becomes a problem.', u'Therefore, the fact that I \"just\" changed the wiper blades on my vehicle just over 2 years ago (well, according to my Amazon purchase records..make that 2 years and 8 months) it was rather surprising to realize how much better these Bosch beam wiper blades were than my last pair!In fact, when I purchased the last pair of wiper blades it was due to good ratings.', u'Piaa Corporation Usa 94048 Wiper Blade Refill 19 (475mm).', u\"These fit my vehicle and were well rated but I specifically remember thinking they weren't that fantastic as there has always been this one little area that tends to streak during heavy rainfall.\", u'Living in Florida where nearly every afternoon in summer brings torrential rain, this is no small consideration.When these Bosch blades came up for review, I quickly looked up my vehicle type using Amazons part finder (a GREAT Idea by the way...thanks Amazon!', u')and figured out which version was needed for my vehicle.', u'When they arrived, my dearest installed them and viola...clear vision!', u'Installation took only a few minutes and was hassle-free.Very pleased.', u\"I'm not sure how often wiper blades should be changed but apparently, more often than I've been doing it.\", u'These are a substantial improvement over the Piaa brand blades right out of the box...no major streaks.', u'Been buying different brands over the past 20 years and these are now my favorites (sorry Triple Edge).', u'Hug the glass nicely, substantial mounting bracket fits easily, no skips or chatter so far.', u'Will be buying these annually I think.', u'Very nice!', u'I am really impressed with the Bosch Clear Advantage wipers.', u\"The Bosch wipers are of such solid construction and quality I have now put them on both of my vehicles though the other was not yet due for new wiper blades - good thing they're a good value, too!\", u'True they are slightly more costly upfront than several competing brands; when it comes to safety aspects and peace of mind we err on the side of caution.', u'Afterall, our loved ones lives are at stake.The 21\" wiper fit our \\'06 Dodge Durango (front - passenger side) perfectly and is a great replacement.', u'It was very easy to install the entire arm assembly instead of the old days of fighting to change just the rubber \"blade\".', u'I easily had both front wiper blades replaced within 5 minutes.', u'Awesome!', u'Bosch is a name that can be trusted, I highly recommend these wipers.', u'If you have an \\'06 Durango, the driver\\'s side front wiper is theBosch 26-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade - 26\".Note: these wipers are sold individually and some vehicles need 2 different sizes for the front.', u'Additionally SUVs often require a different size for the rear wiper.', u'Be sure to use Amazon\\'s nifty \"Find Part\" tool to verify these wipers will fit your vehicle.', u'If you include your vehicle in the \"My Garage\" feature of Amazon it makes finding replacement parts a breeze to confidently order replacement parts and know they will fit your vehicle(s).', u'I live in Central Florida and it rains hard almost everyday during our so-called Hurricane Seasons with severe pop up Thunderstorms and many times hail.', u'I have been buying these Bosch Wipers from both my BMW and my Isuzu SUV.', u'The rubber does seperate after about a year but the replacement is easy and fairly cheap.', u'A word of warning: These wipers are NOT sold in pairs.', u'You must state 2 in quantity.', u'I made that mistake thinking that; &#34;Who the hell would sell you a single wiper blade?', u\"Amazon, that's who.. so I had to order another one.\", u'Both left and right are the same I presume.', u'So other than the buying problem, rest assured these Wipers are &#34;tops&#34; in the Market.', u'The Bosch wiper blades work very well and make good contact with the glass along the whole length of the blade.', u\"Unfortunately, they just don't look very nice.\", u'The blade part itself is kind of big and fat and the connector is even larger.', u\"Although I'd have to admit that overall the Bosch wipers probably have less of a profile than the older metal wipers my car had, these just *look* big and fat and even clumsy in comparison.\", u'At least they work well.', u\"I'm  a trained storm spotter and I drive a honda ridgeline truck and I've used Bosch blades for a long time now and even in the harshest rain.\", u\"I've ALWAYS been impressed with the performance of Bosch blades.\", u'The blades do a great job at keeping the window clean, they move large amounts of water and seem to hold up really well.', u'One thing I love about these blades is that the design is such that the more wind that hits these the harder they push down on your windshield which means they are more effective.', u\"I'll continue to use Bosch blades on my truck and my wifes car.\", u'I replaced the blades on my 2007 Toyota Corolla with this blade and theBosch 24-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade - 24\".', u'The blades they replaced were a pair of OEM blades that I picked up from the dealership during routine maintenance late last year.', u'The OEM blades were worn, performing poorly and leaving streaks behind, so it was definitely time for replacement.', u'The Bosch CA blades easily snapped right onto the vehicle in seconds.', u'The CA blades are thicker and much more solid looking than the OEM blades they replaced.', u'Although they work fantastic in the rain, the real test is how well they will perform in extreme conditions (snow, ice, high winds, etc) and how long they last.', u'I replaced three wiper blades (front and rear) on my 2006 Sienna with Bosch Evolution blades this past March.', u'All three are still working perfectly and I have been happy with them so far.', u\"I installed the Evolution blades just before spring, so although they did great with the spring and summer rain storms, I haven't yet had a chance to test them with snow and ice yet.\", u'So this winter will be a test for both Bosch models.', u'As long as they both handle the snow and ice reasonably well, the best performer will be the replacement blade of choice for both of my vehicles next year.', u'It seems to be somewhat difficult to find a high quality wiper in this size.', u'13&#34;.', u\"While I can't claim to be an expert on all things windshield wiper, I can say from personal experience that this &#34;style&#34; of blade seems to last longer, and remove water much better than those crappy multiple arm versions.\", u'On the other types of blades, such as the cheapos sold by Rain-X, you have those little arms that lead from the metal part, down to the rubber.', u'They hold it and apply pressure to it.', u\"I don't know why but that style of blade just seems to pale in comparison to this one.\", u'There are several companies that make this type, Bosch being one of them.', u'Michelin being another.', u\"All I know is, I've switched to this type of blade and I'm not looking back.\", u'This wiper was easy to install.', u\"The directions really aren't of any help, but more or less I was able to just slide off the old one and slide on the new one (you may have to fiddle a bit with the catches - which may not be obvious).Without any inclement weather I can't give a first hand account of it's performance.\", u'The design is interesting as the frame is significantly wider than a stock wiper.', u\"I'm curious to see how this will work in snow.\", u'It may just collect more snow and work worse, or perhaps the design will better remove accumulated snow.', u\"Until I bought the Rain-X wipers I didn't believe there was actually such a thing as streak free wiper blades.\", u'And I like the metal free exterior frame design as well because it meant I no longer had to literally be chopping away at ice encased wiper blades in the wintertime.', u'But I did wonder why no one else made a similarly well functioning product.When I got my hands on a pair of Bosch Clear Advantage blades to try in place of my Rain-X Latitude wipers I was a bit unimpressed because except for the brand logo they appear to me to be the same in every respect.', u\"They're even priced about the same.So I love them, they're the 'other best' wiper blades I've ever used, but they could have taken at least one little step to differentiate the product.\", u'May I suggest for example different colors.', u'My car is silver; I might like a pair of silver wiper blades, or some other color.', u\"I pick out different colors for parts on my high end bicycles which cost $5,000 a piece, so why wouldn't I be interested in doing something like that with my car.Just a suggestion.\", u'I bought this 18CA wiper for my Frontier and it was real easy to install them.', u'It took more time to take out my old Goodyear wipers that lasted me about 6months.', u'These Bosch wipers run very smooth and no streaks.', u'We will see how long they last me.', u'The installation is easy and the fit clips in securely.', u\"The blade's arch form maintains contact with the glass surface for consistently clear wipes.\", u'I am quite pleased with the results.The Clear Advantage blades have a nice clean look.', u'The cost is reasonable for excellent performance.', u'I purchase nothing but Bosch blades.', u'Yes, they are more expensive.', u'However, they last longer and clean better than others I have tried.', u\"There's not much more I can ask from a wiper blade than this: good price, easy installation, and no streaking when I use my wipers!\", u\"My old wiper blades clearly needed to be replaced as they just streaked water across my windshield, while these new Bosch ones just wipe my windshield clean, like they're supposed to.\", u'Not much more needs to be said - they work great and if they ever need to be replaced, I probably would get these again.', u'Very happy with them.', u'This has to be one of the easiest do-it-yourself car maintenance projects.', u'It took about 30 seconds to snap off the old wiper & clip on the new one.', u'The hardest part was figuring out how to take off the old wipers.The installation instructions are pictorial; no words.', u'There are no buttons to snap; just slide the metal \"J\" shape clip over the wiper mechanism.The wipers work well; no streaks & no blowing around at highway speed.', u'The Bosch 16\" Clear Advantage wiper blade fit the passenger side of my 2007 Hyundai Accent perfectly.', u'It was simple and quick to install.', u'The blades mount well to the car and feel sturdy.I first tried these in a light mist with my windshield caked with salt from being parked for several hours at the beach.', u'I was amazed at how quickly they cleared the residue and left no streaks.', u'It literally took three strokes across the windshield to get them clear.', u'My old wipers would have taken a couple minutes.I then went out driving in a typical Florida downpour.', u'I tried the blades with all the available settings in my car; intermittent, low and high speed.', u\"They were almost completely silent other than a slight, nearly inaudible, 'squig' noise when the blades were fully 'up' and the rain was light.\", u'In moderate, heavy and torrential rain they were whisper quiet.The blades cleared my windshield very well.', u'Even in the worst downpour I could easily see the road.', u'At one point the rain was heavy enough that several other drivers pulled to the side of the road to wait for the rain to let up.', u'I was able to continue driving with confidence.Highly recommended!I will update this review as needed if any durability issues arise over time.', u'This is a good wiper but there are others just as good that look better and last as long.', u'Look at the Trico Teflon.', u'Compelled to write a Bosch Clr Adv review after a lengthy road trip, close to 1K miles in 3 days.It seems about two-thirds of the trip was in a Florida summer downpour, with highly limited visibility.The Bosch wipers worked great.', u\"I'd buy them again in a flash, especially at the under-$12 price.Installation was a snap, so easy that I thought I must have done it wrong.DYI, these are replacements for Rain-X wipers (never again for Rain-X, purchased four wipers for two vehicles; all had cracking runner within months).\", u'I opened my package and thought, \"Do I have enough time to install this before leaving?\"', u'I figured it was worth a try.', u'In less than 5 seconds, it was on.', u'It was so easy to slip off my old one and slip the hook on.The wiper seems to work well.', u'It clears the entire area whether there is a drizzle or downpour.', u\"I haven't seen any streaking or gap areas yet.So a good price for a great wiper.\", u\"Before you buy wipers make sure that you've got ones that are compatible with your year, make, and model.\", u'Amazon has a really nice \"Find Parts that Fit Your Vehicle\" feature that should make it easy for you to see whether a specific size and type of wiper (the connector primarily) can go on your car.This specific wiper is a driver\\'s side replacement on my 2003 Toyota.', u\"I have been usingBosch ICON Wiper Bladeswhich are easily the best wipers I've ever used.\", u'They hug tightly, move smoothly, and are virtually streakless on the window.', u'So far, this Bosch 21-CA Clear Advantage model is performing the same as the more expensive ICON version.', u'We\\'ve had about a dozen \"rain incidents\" since these have been installed (and they installed easily) and I have no complaints.An easy 5 stars for a product that does what it says and does it well.', u'A HUGE step up (for me) from the $2 discount blades I usually get.', u'What I liked was that it was easy to get into the package.', u'The product itself was very straightforward, easy to install.', u\"Took me two minutes.The set I'm replacing had a metal body frame.\", u\"This one is plastic, so I'm worried that it might not hold up.\", u\"It does seem well-made, and my vehicle is garage-kept, so hopefully this won't be an issue.\", u'Time will tell.My visibility has definitely improved from my old set.', u'Wiper blade for car.', u'Great  product.', u'Definitely as described.', u'Highly recommend.', u'Needed new blades and these are the ones that I picked.', u'I like the Bosch Clear Advantage arrangement as a quick and easy replacement for original wipers.', u'This configuration features a curved back with the rubber directly attached.', u'It works great in rain.', u'This new line is less expensive and geared for areas with rain.', u'It is also an advantage to someone who is not planning to keep their vehicle a long time.For snow and ice where more rigidity and strength is required, I would definitely spend the extra money for the heavy duty, long lasting Bosch ICON line.', u'I drive a small size SUV and got this to use on my windshield.', u'This was my very first attempt to install a replacement blade and I found it rather easy to do.One of the challenges I face at work is dirt from salt and sand from the ocean.', u\"The wipers have done a great job so far in cleaning the mess without leaving a streak.We've had quite a bit of rain this month and the wiper covers the entire area without any skips, streaks or squeaking.\", u'This is a great wiper.', u'I had a rain-x wiper and it was okay.', u\"This one is quiet (doesn't squeak) and clears water very well.\", u'Highly recommended.', u\"I won't buy any other wipers for our cars.\", u'Bosch is the way to go!', u'Worth the little extra in cost Bosch 13-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade - 13\" is a nice rear wipe and easy to install.', u'For $10.00 plus tax, the blade is priced fairly.', u'Time will tell how long it lasts.', u'These kind of blades usually last 6 to 12 months depending on usage.', u'Overall, an effective blade.', u'Great fit These work amazing but we had some snow pileup this winter and one of the wipers somehow got damaged.', u'Now anytime I raise it up the thing just comes right off.', u'I looked at this and it appears that one of the plastic pieces that attaches to the cars wiper arm just broke off.', u\"Not sure if this is a fault of the wiper or the snow, but it's never happened to me before.\", u'Other than that, these things are perfect.', u'What a great wiper blade!', u'Absolutely flawless at leaving a perfectly dry windshield, even through light mist or drizzle.I love the curved design.', u'This worked fantastic for the rear wiper arm of my Jeep, on which the spring has weakened and the wiper arm no longer presses normal wipers against the windshield hard enough to work well.', u'This curved design hugs the back window perfectly and makes it streak-free every time.I have only had these a month or so, so I cannot attest to longevity, but my first impression is very, very good!', u'This thing was the correct size and very easy to install.', u'It cleans the water off of my windshield.', u'Whee!', u'I used to only buy RainX brands and found these through Amazon with great prior reviews - so I took a chance.', u'These are actually quite nice.', u'They are quiet and seem to hold tighter to my windshield the previous blades.', u'I finally got to use my new wiper blades today - this and a 21\"er - with the first rains from Hurricane Sandy coming through.', u'They work perfect!', u'Test 1 complete.', u'The harder test is how long they last, but I have no doubts they will perform better than whatever I bought last time at the local auto parts store.', u\"I could tell out of the packaging that they were exceptional: the entire frame is a spring that had the blade more curved than any I've seen out of the box.\", u\"It then straightened out perfectly on my windshield.Check your car's manual carefully.\", u'I am by no means an idiot when it comes to such things, but I had a pair of 20\"ers on before (can\\'t remember if

u'Windshield wipers have become easier to install.', u\"This installed easily on the driver's side of Chevy Avalanche 2004 and is working like a dream.\", u'The parts finder says this does not fit
