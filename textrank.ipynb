      "Spiritually and mentally inspiring! A book that allows you to question your morals and will help you discover who you really are! This is one my must have books. It is a masterpiece of spirituality. I'll be the first to admit, its literary quality isn't much. It is rather simplistically written, but the message behind it is so powerful that you have to read it. It will take you to enlightenment. This book provides a reflection that you can apply to your own life.And, a way for you to try and assess whether you are truly doing the right thing and making the most of your short time on this plane. I first read THE PROPHET in college back in the 60's. The book had a revival as did anything metaphysical in the turbulent 60's. It had a profound effect on me and became a book I always took with me. After graduation I joined the Peace Corps and during stressful training in country (Liberia) at times of illness and the night before I left, this book gave me great comfort. I read it before I married, just before and again after my children were born and again after two near fatal illnesses. I am always amazed that there is a chapter that reaches out to you, grabs you and offers both comfort and hope for the future.Gibran offers timeless insights and love with each word. I think that we as a nation should read AND learn the lessons here. It is definitely a time for thought and reflection this book could guide us through. A timeless classic.  It is a very demanding and assuming title, but Gibran backs it up with some excellent style and content.  If he had the means to publish it a century or two earlier, he could have inspired a new religion.From the mouth of an old man about to sail away to a far away destination, we hear the wisdom of life and all important aspects of it.  It is a messege.  A guide book.  A Sufi sermon. Much is put in perspective without any hint of a dogma.  There is much that hints at his birth place, Lebanon where many of the old prophets walked the Earth and where this book project first germinated most likely.Probably becuase it was written in English originally, the writing flows, it is pleasant to read, and the charcoal drawings of the author decorating the pages is a plus.  I loved the cover. Reading this made my mind feel like a still pool of water, cool and quiet in a mossy grotto.  It's direct and simple wisdom has a depth of complexity that takes a quiet day to sink in, leaving you at peace.  It is best to set time aside for it, relax, absorb, and let it softly clear your mind. As you read, Gibran's poetry brings spiritual and visual beauty to life within you. Gibran is justly famous for rich metaphors that brilliantly highlight the pursuit of Truth and Goodness amidst all the darkness and light of human nature. Deep, moving dramatic verses of the heart and soul.Truths of  ancient wisdom from a true and romantic poet.Relevant for all eternity. This is a timeless classic.  Over the years I've given it as a gift more times than I can count, and will continue to do so.  Addresses real life issues in a beautiful way and makes us reexamine our own attitude about how we see what happens in our lives.  So easy to read over and over. An amazing work. Realizing extensive use of Biblical imagery and sentence structure, &#34;The Prophet&#34; by Khalil Gibran is a literary classic. Influencing the Free Love movement of the 1960's, Gibran's master work explores themes of love, longing and loss. I LOVE this book... his writing seems to just flow from page to page. I get something different from this book each time I read it.. This book has been a classic for many years. It has so much wisdom in it that it can be read numerous times and new things will come out each time. My favorite chapter is the one on children. This book has so much you can take out of it to use in your real life. Amazing, and one of my favorite reads of all time. When I was in college in the 70's this book had a revival and I did not read it then.  Recently a friend (who is 90) and I were talking about work and she said: &quot;work is love made visible,&quot; and told me it was from the Prophet.  I though that was so beautiful I got the book and was not disappointed.You see, if you have ideas and you do not realize them, then they are nothing, and if your ideas do not come from love and joy, then they are bitter and what they produce will be bitter, but if they flow from love and joy, then their realization will be love and joy, thus work is love made visible.He says it WAY better that I do and says much more in just a few paragraphs.  But as you can see from the example, what he says is not religious, but positive ways of looking at things.  Since I rediscoverd the book I have given away many copies and everyone I have given it to sincerly thanked me. I discovered The Prophet fifty years ago in college and have read it dozens of times since then.  Now, in addition to my beat up hard copy, I have a portable e-copy.  If you were looking for an example of an intelligently designed (pun intended) book of spiritual guidance, this would be it.  It doesn't care how you picture, name or define &#34;God&#34; or whether you give him a gender and a personality.  It just cuts to the heart of how to live and how to relate to others.  If Jesus and the Buddha teamed up to write a book, it might come out like this.When I first read it, I found some passages difficult to grasp.  Looking back, I now think that it was not because they were hard to understand, but because I did not want to hear gently spoken, intelligently phrased ideas that contradicted my own.  Now, if I could have only one book, this would probably be it. Can't say enough about Kahlil Gibran's work among this piece. Everybody in the whole world should read this! There is almost too much to take in, really appreciate and put towards our daily lives. In my opinion, it is just one of the most beautiful literature pieces ever written. Would recommend to as a gift for anyone spiritual/poetic/philosophy/educational piece or just something to enjoy here and there. 5 stars for sure! I have the 1972 version, bought in 1974. The 1972 version originally had a dust jacket but my dust jacket is long gone. This particular rendition has had many re-printings, for a reason: it's very popular. The textured paper, old-style typography, and leather cover are better than a plain-old paperback. The size is diminutive, which is perfect for this book. Anything I've read by Gibran is, in my mind, flawless. This, the most famous of his works, is no exception. It is simple, yet deep; honest and profound; moving and inspirational. Gibran's work is one of a kind, and can be far more encouraging and moving than any self-help program or therapy or anything like that. The poetic style, the aphorisms, the parables, the almost biblical feel, are all just what over-worked, over-stressed, modern and spiritually starved worldly people need. Cool book, I really like the quality of the production.  Black clothbound with gold embossing and nice paper, looks to be cotton rag.  I am proud to include it in my collection.  Intrigueing story full of the sort of passion that does not cloud the mind or divert truth but instead is revealing and living. Very readable, the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed. It is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life.  The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by Jesus.  I give it 5 stars. I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end...and then start over for that matter.  Excellent for busy people or commuters! This book is everything that is simple, delicate, true, and beautiful.I have read few books so touching and enlightening; &quot;The Prophet&quot; is a true masterpiece that has that feeling of ancient wisdom in it. The wisdom of the text is gentle, yet insistent, it lets you understand things you've always known.My feelings defy description. For those who don't know Gibran, get to know his work. The Prophet is a must read. His outlook on life is truly an inspiring guide on how to approach major life decisions. This is a relationship with a man's work you won't regret having. I would have to say that this is the best book I've ever read.. I could feel every word deep in my heart everytime, of the many times I've read it!  I would never get enough of it! its a treasure.. Loved this book since first I read it, years gone by.  Purchased this copy for a friend who has not ever read Gibran. I first read The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran over 30 years ago and have read it many times since. Gibran's messages are timeless and have always influenced my life and relationships. Over the years I have used it as a gift for persons I cared about. This paperback version has a lovely cover and makes a nice yet inexpensive gift containing valuable lessons for anyone. I purchased three for future giving at the special price offered. It's a thin book which has deep thoughts about topics like love, generosity, death, prayer, etc. It can be read again and again because it is thin while at the sametime it contains so many words of wisdon. Who can ever say anything negative about this great philosopher poet, artist?  Read, enjoy, and apply to your own life. Excellent BookFull of wisdom.  Even though the book wasn't preachey there were a lot of references made to the bible made. I bought this book to supplement a recording I treasure in my collection.. The Prophet is truly inspirational, and poetically illustrates the many challenges and journeys the human spirit traverses from birth to death. The utterings are omni - religious and subtly explain the basic principles  of the human lifespan from an authoritative and spiritual perspective. A must- have for any deep or not-so-deep thinker. This is a fantastic book and I would definitely recommend it to everyone.  Quick read, but also very insightful. It really makes you think. I only wish I could read the original text.  The simplicity and frankness, the blend of respect for the individual and appreciation of spirituality--this is the most astonishing work I have ever read. One of the most profound books I have ever read. You can learn alot about love, life and relationships after reading this book. Very insightful. This is one of the first (literary) books I recall reading. My mother kept a collection of Gibran's works that she often read. I was curious to see what attracted her, so I looked into them too ( I was either eight or nine  at the time). I believe that was my first taste of spirituality and seemed  at the time more relevant than what I was being force-fed by nuns in  catechism class. Rereading Gibran now, I'm struck by the notion that Hesse  must have been aware of these texts before he wrote Siddhartha. They  contain many of the same themes: No one else can guide you on your path.  You must select your own course. Preachers and prophets are a dime a dozen.  True wisdom comes from within.The prophet's teaching on love is  particularly relevant to me at this stage of my life:&quot;For even as  love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so  is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your  tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, So shall he descend to your  roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth. Like sheaves of corn  he gathers you unto himself. He threshes you to make you naked. He sifts  you to free you from your husks. He grinds you to whiteness. He kneads you  until you are pliant; And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you  may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.&quot;Look into these  books. They may appear simplistic to the jaundiced eye, but they may also  provide the inspiration you need to see you through life's travails. Kahlil is so amazing.  To try to express his wisdom with my own words would be more like an insult.  Just read the book and just let it soak in.Carl BozemanAuthor: Amazon bestselling book; &#34;On Being God - Beyond Your Life's PurposeAre You Listening? Addressing the Divine Within &On Human Being - Loving and Living Without Purpose This is one of the best, most inspiring philosophy/poetry books ever written!  I have read it over and over, though never tire of it.  It is a great reminder for what's most important in life and puts everything in perspective.  My favorite 'chapters' are Love, Marriage, Children and The first look. I am a romantic though, so the other chapters may appeal to you more....;-)  Absolutely classic and timeless.  Perfectly stands the test of time. My personal copy is from 1948 and is one of my favorite treasures. This is Gibran's most celebrated work and it is so with goodreason.  It is a profound insight and expose into the human characterand the emotions that work within the heart and soul.  Humble words,seared with the heights and depths of love and of pain, this is a life-changing arrangement of words.  If I had to sum the book up in one word, it would be &quot;SUBLIME.&quot; If you're picking up this title, be sure to order Gibran's 'The Beloved' to go along with it. These are books that deserve a worthy and permanent place on your bookshelf. Intrinsically, this book utilizes a flowing a cleaver way to express the ideological interpretations of the author. While, personally, I found nothing profound in the ideologies expressed in the book, I did find it, simply a pleasure to read. Even with the lack of philosophical epiphany, the style of the book in its fluid manner, the parallel structure of the chapters, and the brevity combined with the larger font in the piece, leave the reader, whether they agree with the philosophies therein or not, in a state of solemn peace and the feeling that they have not wasted their time. As, really, they probably have not, it really did not waste my time anyway; it only took a little over an hour to read (with breaks). When I first started writing poetry at age 12 or 13, I was encouraged to read other poets.  Something I refused to do because I thought it might influence, \"My Style\"...:)OK, so I was hard headed...  I later was introduced by a Brother In Law to Kahlil Gibran and it was like finding a kindred soul.  I now totally encourage any one that want's to excel in poetry to read the greats.  And you won't find many of the caliber of this man!!!  His words sing from the page both in his poetry and in his short stories!  I love \"Martyr's To Man\"  (It's been a while but some of the words are still singed in my brain...  And I think it truly speaks of the time we are living in now more than ever...  From memory so not verbatim...Are you a soldier?Who must forsake wife and children?And go fourth into the fields of battle?For the sake of greedWhich your leaders miscall duty?Than you are a martyr to man!There's more but the gist of what I am saying is if you love poetry and you haven't read any Kahlil Gibran you're missing out on one of the greatest poets to ever live!And if you write poetry, I firmly believe Kahlil Gibran should be recquired reading!!!Not that you will feel you have to plod your way through it...You too, will fall in love with his immense gifts!!!Sincerely,And best wishes to allChase vonYour Chance to Hear The Last Panther Speak Beautiful and peaceful read. I carry it in my purse and read it whenever I am waiting for the Doctor, at the airport, etc. This book was great; each chapter was a nugget of wisdom, resulting in a treasure trove by the end. It's no wonder this book is called a classic. Gibran uses a literary style inspired by the Bible, but it is still easy to read. Has a lot of philosophical ideas that I'm sure I will revisit in the future. Seems like one of those books that you learn something new every time you reread it. Definitely recommend, especially for anyone new to philosophy reading because it is short and easy to read. A decade past, I knew very little about the writer/artist/poet/prophet, Kahlil Gibran. I am happy to say, that today, I am well acquainted with his work. The Prophet was the first book I read written by Gibran, and ever since that first reading I have immersed myself in his extraordinarily consummate skill of exquisitely crafted words. To say the Prophet or any other writings by Kahlil Gibran is simply fine literature is to say the mysterious of the soul are mediocre. I recommend that if you have not touched upon any of Kahlil Gibran's books, that you consider the Prophet as a good start. You will not be disappointed. A few other extraordinary works of art by Gibran: The Voice Of The Master; The Beloved; Sand And Foam; The Broken Wings; Between Night And Morn; The Earth Gods; and one of my personal favorites, though not so much a \"story,\" but rather a collection of personal letters to dearly beloved friends: Kahlil Gibran: A Self-Portrait. The Prophet is Kahlil Gibran's best known work in the western world with over 25 million copies sold. It is said that Kahlil spent more than 20 years writing The Prophet and held onto the manuscript for 4 years before finally releasing it for publication. Kahlil referred to The Prophet as the \"strange little book\" or \"the little black book\" in reference to its cover. The working title of this strange little book was \"The Counsels\" - the final version consisting of 26 `verses'.In The Prophet the philosophy of East and West meet in a union unparalleled in the literature of the early 20th century. Kahlil acknowledged that he was inspired by a multitude of writers and that is evident throughout The Prophet. Most notably the visions of William Blake, who Kahlil referred to as \"the poet-prophet par-excellence\" (incidentally one of Kahlil's mentors the sculptor Rodin called Kahlil the 20th century Blake), The Prophet was also heavily influenced by the Bible, Buddhism, Hinduism, the English Romantics, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ameen Rihani, and Christian and Sufi mysticism.When The Prophet was first published the early 20th century critic Claude Bragdon wrote of its, \"extraordinary dramatic power, deep erudition, lightning-like intuition, lyrical lift and metrical mastery with which the message is presented, and the beauty, beauty, beauty, which permeates the entire pattern.\" Wow that's a powerful critique...and let's listen to his close friend and one of his biographers Mary Haskell who wrote to Kahlil after she received a copy of The Prophet:\"Beloved Kahlil, The Prophet came today, and it did more than realize my hopes. For it seemed in its compacted form to open yet further new doors of desire and imagination in me, and to create about itself the universe in nimbus......This book will be held as one of the treasures of English literature. And in our darkness we will open it to find ourselves again and the heaven and earth within ourselves. Generations will not exhaust it, but instead, generation after generation will find in the book what they would fain be - and it will be better loved as men grow riper and riper. It is the most loving book ever written.\"I can add little more than that...other than Haskell had a very good point. Love this book. Every time I buy one, I give it away.  This one is for me.  The book arrived on time and in good condition. Gibran Khalil Gibran was born in 1883 in what is now Northern Lebanon.  In 1909 he went to Paris to study, but he did not like the strict education, and so he traveled, eventually moving to New York.  Gibran became both an artist and a writer, and in 1923 he published \"The Prophet\", which is generally considered to be his greatest work.  He died of cancer in a New York hospital at the very young age of 48.The Prophet is a story about Almustafa (The Prophet) who after living 12 years in Orphalese is about to depart aboard ship to return to his home.  Before he goes, a group of people stop him, and to them he teaches the secrets of life.  Gibran writes in a very poetic manner, and it is wonderful to read. Compared it to works like &#34;Tarantula&#34; by Bob Dylan. Purchased this time as a gift, it was received with praise per its current cover I didn't really know what to expect when I purchased this. I knew only that it was a well-regarded book, and that it was said to be full of wisdom.What I found was a story that was easy to read. There are few words per page, covering the sayings of a wise man as he speaks to those around him. There is a kind of poetry in the words, but not the kind that is difficult to understand. The insights were both familiar and refreshing. It made me reconsider my notions of all aspects of life, although it was less a spiritual revolution than a gentle awakening.I bought the hardcover. It is small and sits easily in one hand. The pages are made from a rich-feeling, textured paper that feels nice to the fingertips. And the text is printed in spacious and easy to read letters. Throughout the book are scattered drawings that Kahlil Gibran made. I like them. I feel they add to the experience of reading this book, although I can't quite put my finger on the reason.While spiritual, it does not, as far as I could tell, convey any beliefs specific to any religion or even assume a readily recognizable god. Gibran says, \"... the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks, than to the least of all the blades of grass.\" (pp 27-28)  The notion of god that emerges from these pages is of a pervasive connectedness or oneness with nature and the universe. As the author of a spiritually-themed book entitled \"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude,\" I appreciate any book that opens the doors to spiritual understanding. There are few contemporary books that will do this for you in such a poetic way.This is a book containing eternal truths. It was given to me as a high school graduation present many years ago. At the time, I found it beautiful, but I couldn't understand it. That is because I hadn't experienced life.Selections from this book were read at my wedding. The sections on love speak of what it is truly about. Most of us never have an inkling of what true love is since we are caught up in a world of attachment to illusions and delusions. This book will help you to break through them.This is a classic that will stand the mark of time such as the Bible has done. Kahlil Gibran is an old soul who speaks in a language that can be embraced by people of any faith.The book is filled with metaphors and parables. It is almost as if Jesus himself is speaking through the author. Whether or not you will be able to comprehend what the author is speaking about, The Prophet will plant seeds that can bear good fruit.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\" Eloquent and full of divine wisdom, this little treatise packs more truth into 96 pages than you're going to find anywhere else.  I'll continue to read passages each morning just to remind myself of the beauty and magic of life. I have this entire series in the original, but nothing is quite so good as this one. A wise master is leaving the city. As he departs, the crowd shouts out for him to impart his knowledge. \"Teach us about love, education, power, knowledge, etc\" they cry. A simple plot for the organization of timeless wisdom. I had this book before and lost it when I moved and I just love it touches my soul and gives me perspective on life. \" When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow is that giving you joy. When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.\"  G. K. Gibran, The ProphetThe Prophet:Gibran's best-known work, The Prophet, is a collection of poetic essays, which became more popular with the rise of American New Age movement during the 1960s. Since its first publication in 1923, The Prophet has never been out of print. It was translated into more than twenty languages, and became one of the twentieth century best selling books, in the United States. The Prophet evoked the journey of the Promeathian exile, he called Al Mustafa (the Chosen One, one of Islam's prophet favorite adjectives). Gibran added to the work, a separate work he had attached to the story of Al Mustafa. Gibran has later linked the roots of his poetic collection to a work he wrote as a teenager in Arabic.Quote from The Prophet, Self-knowledge:*Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart's knowledge.You would know in words that you have always known in thought.You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.*And it is well that you should.The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea; and the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.But let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure;And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.For self is a sea boundless and measureless.G. Khalil Gibran, 1883-1931:I encountered Gibran as a young kid, even before appreciating Arabic poetry. I was then amazed by the beauty of his art and the romance of his expression, in 'The Prophet.' I read him, later in Arabic, before I realized how the Lebanese emigrant poet has touched the Western hearts. Gibran's collection of early stories, parables and poetic prose, were written in Arabic before his works were translated into English, earning him the nickname 'the Shelly of the Orient.' Many Arabic speaking intelligentsia, including my dad thought he has qualified, before Naguib Mahfouz was elected, to have been the first Nobel Laureate Arabic writer !Classic Book Reviews:\"It is Gibran's gift to us, as well, for Gibran's prophet is rivaled in his wisdom only by the founders of the world's great religions. --his words have a power and lucidity that in another era would surely have provoked the description \"divinely inspired.\"  Brian Bruya\"His power came from some great reservoir of spiritual life else it could not have been so universal and so potent, but the majesty and beauty of the language with which he clothed it were all his own.\"  Claude BragdonPROPHET: LIFE AND TIMES OF KAHLIL GIBRAN Okay I know that Gibhran is supposed to be corny and cliched and assosciated with the hippy movement of the 60's.It does not mean that he also isn't still relevant to anyone seeking answers to what life is about. The set up is simple - as a prophet takes his leave of the people with whom he has stayed for many years, he is asked a series of questions, \"tell us of friendship, of love, of work, of death\". And to each question the prophet provides an answer.For me the message that the prophet provides is that life is not easy and that the greatest joys can only be achieved by risking and enduring great sorrow.But that is only what I took from Gibran and his prophet. Read and take your own message from his words. I received my first copy of this book over 40 years ago.  As a young woman, I found understanding in topics that concerned me; as I aged, my life experiences broadened and this book still gave me understanding and confirmation.I have given this gift to many and they, too, enjoy the book and keep it as a reference.This is a book that keeps on giving what you need as your life experiences or interests change. The prophet by Kahlil Gibran is a very beautiful, inspiring writing which really resonated within me, it felt as truth. I feel that with good patience and deep contemplation, this book can lead you to a profound understanding of your own life and all others around you.I first read about Kahlil Gibran in a book calledThe Lost Teachings of Atlantis. That book answered all my spiritual questions about the meaning of Life, who and what we are and more in a very easily understandable manner and all of it corresponds with the writing of Kahlil Gibran. I HIGHLY recommend reading that book also. _The Prophet_ is a short read (my copy checks in at just under 100 pages), but its berevity belies both the power and beauty of Gibran's words.  At its simplest, it is a discourse on the human condition: love, work, joy and sorrow, crime and punishment, reason and passion, Gibran runs the gamut of emotion and being, laying bare the paradox of who we are as human beings.  While the tone is somewhat mystical (which I didn't really care for), the sheer poetic beauty of his writing moved me.For example, in the chapter \"Love\", Gibran writes, \"... When love beckons to you, follow him, / Though his ways are hard and steep, / And when his wings enfold you yield to him, / Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. / And when he speaks to you believe in him, / ... For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you.  Even as he is for you growth so is he for your pruning. ...\"  The contrast, vivid metaphor and beautiful images were stunning and left me with much to think and reflect on about my own life, and the choices I've made.  It would be going too far to say that, as a result of reading \"The Prophet\" I've had an epiphany or (to take it to a ridiculous conclusion) some sort of a conversion.  Rather it has caused me to consider on a philosophical level what it is to be human means to me, and how I have demonstrated my \"human-ness\" in my life.Part poetry, part philosophy, it is simultaneously thought-provoking and emotional.  Undeniably readers will have a visceral reaction (although, apparently given the reviews of some, not all reactions are positive.)  Highly recommended, if only to cause one to examine their own life.  After all, \"the unexamined life is not worth living.\" The Prophet is about a mysterious religious thinker who is about to leave for his native land.  Before he goes, many people have just one question to ask him.  In a very few words, he tells them his accumulated wisdom primarily in a nondenominational way.  The only exceptions come in the references to rebirth.  The essence of each brief lesson is that we have to step outside of our own perspective to see things in the way that God does and wants us to.Let me give you an example.  When someone transgresses either man's laws or God's laws, we tend to condemn the person harshly and focus on punishment.  This is like treating the person as though they have fallen below some level of what it is still to be human.  Yet no one does anything worse than what some person has done wrong before and will do wrong again.Surely, our reaction should still focus, like a Mother's, on the fundamental humanness of the person and our desire to have the person be a contributing, loving, and helpful part of our community.Another way to think about the lessons of The Prophet is to notice that nature loves a balance.  If we interfere with nature, nature overreacts in some new way that counters our interference.  This happens when we put too much phosphate into lakes.  Algae blooms expand exponentially to eat the phosphate.  These lessons help us to see the balance that is missing in our initial reaction.A good parallel can be found in the study of the brain.  Our initial reactions when frightened or threatened are focused in the oldest parts of the brain.  This part of the brain triggers strong chemicals to be released that engage us in &quot;fight or flight&quot; reactions that can save our lives in the near-term.  In the &quot;civilized&quot; world, we often have these reactions just to stress.  Gibran is helping us move to our highest level of consciousness by choosing our reactions, and selecting reactions that integrate all parts of our brains plus our near- and long-term best interests as individuals and as a community.Many Eastern religions encourage one to become free of the conscious mind, and that sense of objectivity is captured nicely here.  I have a feeling much like when meditating while I read The Prophet, because of its calming influence on my overreactive senses.I also think of this perspective like being on the Moon and observing the circumstances on Earth through a telescope.  With such extreme distance should come detachment from the ego, to permit good thinking.But none of these perspectives are directly suggested or alluded to.  The moral lessons are simply there, with the briefest possible examples to make them clear.  As such, they are masterpieces of good thinking, moral ethics, and fine communication.The answers are so brief and so profound that you will want to discuss them.  I suggest you select another member of your family, or a group of people from your house of worship.  The lessons are best explored by discussing tangible situations that you face every day.  Certainly, it is desirable and appropriate to consider the direct teachings of your religious heritage and beliefs in this connection.Whenever you feel overwhelmed, turn to the page in The Prophet that addresses your issue.  Like taking a warm bath, you will be soothed by the love for humanity in the answers Gibran provides.Before you speak, ask yourself who is about to speak for you and what do they want. Khalil Gibran's book, The Prophet, has the power to transform the darkest feeling of pain in your heart into great release. What a blessing that it exists. Each passage touches on a deep and universal topic (marriage, friendship, etc).  The words, spoken profoundly and clearly from the mouth of the mystic and insightful prophet, who has nothing but words of wisdom to impart to those who gather around him, is a truly life affirming and transformative experience.  Please read this today. It will give you insight on the sacred aspects of all life choices and experiences that exist in the world. Jubran Kahlil Jubran had a teacher make a mistake on his name and wrote down 'Kahlil Gibran' as when he arrived here from Lebanon which was still part of the Ottoman Empire he went by Gibran Kahlil Gibran. His poetry is as timeless as his view towards life and the world at large - everyone was his friend! One passage  &#34;Half of what I say is meaningless, but I say it so that the other half may reach you&#34; was used by John Lennon in the white album on a tune called &#34;Julia &#34;. I plan to buy 3 more copies from Amazon, for my departing son & distant friends.Last night, I made a mad dash to get a copy of this book, ten minutes before the book store closed; because I couldn't find my old one.  I had been trying unsuccessfully for weeks to send out an SOS to a life-long friend whose comforting presence I really needed, even if just by phone.  Long, sun-lit walks through my beautiful neighborhood lined with 100+ year old oaks, magnolias, elms, and maple trees, did not make me feel any better.  At home, the news is only reporting the political and ecomonic turmoil going on world-wide, or the Oscars; the latter which I could care less about.  It was a very sad and loney moment.Back in Miami I would naturally hit the beach, or watch the ocean from my balcony and forget the world.  So, in desperation, I jumped in my vehicle, hit the book store, and called on the wisdom of Mr. Gibran.  I sipped a glass of red, kicked back on my couch, and slowly read aloud each blessed passage on all the areas of life and the challenges they can present.  I don't know why, but this book always makes me cry at the beginning and smile at the end.  In little over an hour I'd read slowly through each page, and felt 100% better.On physical inspection, this would be the student slackers paradise book report choice.  But don't be so easily deceived, because this book packs more useful information than any 50-pound college textbook, without the endless verbage of a 1,000 page Russian novel.It is small, the paper of good weight and quality (the ones I always purchase, at least), the print is big and the illustrations done by Mr. Gibran are simple yet humana and divinical.  The words are brief and powerful, comforting and idiot-proof.  Perfect healing food for the love-starved yet attention-deficit crazy world we now live in.  I was first given this book by a friend, as a departing gift for a 7,000 land/sea voyage, back in 1983.I hope to be there for my friend should he ever need me.  I sent this book to him as my comforting presence. Echoing the reviews of others - it is obvious that Gibran both was inspired by and inspired many of the great writers of all ages.  From Buddha to Coehlo, and countless others in between, there is a depth of truth and a veil of simplicity that, once lifted, opens the mind, heart and soul to universal wisdom.It is not hard to understand why Gibran was as popular in his day, and in the 1960's, as he was.  Covering the landscape from religion to love, Gibran bubbles up deep truths in the form of a farewell speech from the Prophet to the people of his city before he sets sail on a final journey.  The metaphors are numerous and the scale of depth is exceptional.The book itself is nearly 100 pages, but the content is not readable at any level rapidly.  This book is one that bears constant revival and renewal.  It's a well that provides the reader with sweet water of wisdom which merits frequent draws to slake the thirst.A must have and a must read. I stumbled onto this book, and it opened my mind and began my process of becoming aware.Then I went across country to collect my deceased Grandmother's belongings. One item was this book. I opened the the cover and saw that Grandma had lent it out to her friends and they all had signed it. One person who had signed it was my Mom, who had died years before before my Grandma. I'm going to buy it for my little arrow now. 4th generation of passing it on. I read this book many years ago, It is a book that should be on ones book shelf to read often. It takes several readings to get to the heart of his deep writings of philosophy. Glad I replaced the one I lost. These days, Kahlil Gibran's \"The Prophet\" often gets dismissed as \"hippie\" literature. Yet, this book had been a bestseller LONG before the 1960s. Originally published in 1923, it almost instantly became a hit and even did well through the Great Depression. Today, Gibran's claim to fame is being the third best-selling poet of our time, behind Shakespeare and Lao Tzu... and pretty much entirely based on sales of this book. When his publisher, Alfred Knopf was asked who the audience for the book was, he flippantly dismissed the question. \"It Must be a cult,\" he retorted.Yet there is no such cult. What's incredible is that there's absolutely no marketing hype behind the success of this book. Gibran himself is long gone. There is no political, religious, or commercial enterprise attached to his name bent on winning souls and/or profits. The Gibran estate has merely been licensing copies year after year in response to the demand - a demand fueled pretty much entirely by word-of-mouth and chance discovery. The fact is, the twenty-six poems in this book have a surprising and suprassing relevance, insight and compassion. Broken down into several topics (\"On Love\", \"On Work\", \"On Joy and Sorrow\", etc.) the book itself recounts the sermons of a fictional poet leaving behind the gift of knowledge before he leaves his homeland.I first found Gibran through a setting of his poem \"On Children\" by local Washington, D.C. singers Sweet Honey in the Rock on their album, \"Breaths.\"\"Your children are not your children.They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.They come through you but not from you,And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.\"At the time I was about to leave for college and eighteen years of living under my parent's roof had made me restless for autonomy. That poem eloquently expressed everything I was yearning to say to them in my hours of frustration and adolescent angst. It later proved to be a reference to turn to in times where I needed confidence to live an independent and fulfilling life, while still maintaining respect and compassion towards the parents who had raised me.I am not exaggerating when I say that the poems in this book have kept me grounded and sane throughout some of the most troubling times in my life. Our modern lives are ever hectic, stressful and busy - wrought with drama, frustration, depression, etc. The knowledge in these poems brings me back to a \"middle ground\" - there is a sage wisdom and clarity in the poems that has often been helpful for me in \"unwinding\" and coming back to earth. They bring me back to a place of clarity from whcih I can see my life from a wider perspective.Though Gibran himself was a Christian and despite the title and conceit of the book, this is not really a religious book. The insight in this book would be applicable to your life even if you are an atheist. What's more, the poetry is mostly imagistic. Do not expect the academic poetics of Gibran's contemporaries Eliot or Pound or even Frost. They are written with the aim of being accessible and immediate to the reader and rely mostly on clear metaphors and vivid imagery.Copies of \"The Prophet\" are not hard to come by. Perhaps check out the book's table of contexts either using Amazon's \"Search Inside\" feature or in your local bookstore and see if it addresses a problem or issue you are dealing with. That's a good a place as any to start with. Chances are, you will find something that speaks to you on some level. I have loved this book for forty years, both the written version and the audio (Richard Harris narrating I believe) with orchestral accompaniment. This new format only increases its accessibility. When Gibran was first introduced to me, I had definite doubts that his work would be the ordinary, grab a dictionary sort of read. But when you first open to those sections that apply to you, and listen to the words as they roll off of your tongue and dance in your ears, well, shock is the only word for it. Yes, the ideals and beliefs that he expresses in 'The Prophet' may not be anything new as far as philosophy is concerned, but the perfect blend of brilliant poetry and this simple philosophy come together to make something that is indeed, unique. I've purchased countless copies to the ones that I know will love and understand his words. And if for nothing else, Kahlil's work can be labeled as truly, a literary work of art. Kahlil Gibran - touchs the heart, the soul and the mind.Beautiful words that comfort and guide.If only more people would read his work, if you can call it work,Wonderful writing but the publisher (as many seem to do these days) get very artisticand print too faintly -  the letters are pale grey and very difficult to read.It isn't the writing it's the publisher at fault.The printers should realize that the entire purpose of the printed word isto let people READ it. The Prophet, for me, is a very vivid yet dense book. It speaks some sort of wisdom, and I delight in that wisdom when I can understand it.The illustrations are done by the author himself, which is nice. This book is almost as if Kahlil Gibran took the pains and joys of millions of people and somehow managed to encapsulate all these wonders in this one book.  In his own unique manner, Gibran has explored every facet  of human existence.  Although the book has a sacred charm to it, there is a  universal appeal that should allow anyone of any religious persuassion  enjoy this gem of a book. I wouldn't be surprised if a few hundred years  from now some theologians unearth this book and conclude that it was a  bible of our times. Have purchased many in the past like in the 1970'safter I received one as a gift.  I recommend to all ages. Kahlil Gibran is a wonderful poet. He is a philosopher who meshes the bible with his prose. Very spiritual to read. Residing in my mind are the words of a true poet.  I was given the book THE PROPHET by my best friend when I was young.  It has followed me through my life and has filled me with the emotions and practical thought I needed to guide me through the smooth and rough waters of my life.  I gave this copy of Kahil Gibran's book to a young lady with the hope she will enjoy it the rest of her life.  Thank you Amazon for having this wonderful work of art available to all. Certainly the words are of Kahlil Gibran, but the eternally PRESENT divine wisdom told through his words is from the source of all sources. Only those who are ready to receive the divine wisdom are destined to read and know the meaning behind the meanings of his words. This is one of the five most valued books that I keep on refering again and again for solace and peace of MYSELF.While writing - or rather while being an instrument to write this book - Kahlil Gibran must have reached the original source of all the knowledge and wisdom available to humankind.Gibran's book is music, poetry, wisdom and truth - all at the same time!I salute Kahlil Gibran for giving us the &quot;THE PROPHET&quot;. If there were more than five stars, this book would surely deserve it.  This book is the paradigm of wisdom, humility, and grace.  This is my favorite book on my shelf, and I would recommend this book to anyone.  Truly, if Gibran was a religion, The Prophet would be my Bible.  Never has  inspiration hit me with such velocity as reading this book. It has helped to replace the many dysfunctional premises my sociopathic parents modeled! This is a book with a popularity which continues to grow at phenomenal rates! I had to buy this version since I'd lost my original classic one. There certainly NEED to be more Half Price Book Stores here in CA!!! I got spoiled by having 3-4 in Dallas alone! I was given this book by a writer friend who called it &quot;the most beautiful book I've ever read.&quot; So, since she and I have similar literary tastes, I was inclined to read it. This little book, written in a rich, colorful, deep, and wise poetic style, is full of some of the most moving and impressive spiritual phrases and messages I've ever read. It was written in 1923 but its poetry and wisdom are timeless.David Rehakauthor of &quot;Poems From My Bleeding Heart&quot; The Prophet is a poetic, in some aspects, means of viewing life.  Kahlil Gibran was able to draw on various aspects of life and compile a take that is, in some senses, new and appreciable. I usually don't like getting books that I did not ask for. When someone buys a book for me, there is a certain obligation to actually read it, but doing so takes away time from the books I really want to read. There are so many books on my reading list and so little time to read them all that getting an unasked-for book feels like someone actually stealing from me: stealing valuable reading time.In the case of *The Prophet,* however, I did not resent the choice of my benefactor, even though I had not asked for it.First of all, it was a very quick read, consisting of twenty-nine poetic speeches by the fictional \"prophet.\" He delivers them as his last word on various topics, since he is about to head back home after having lived in a foreign city for twelve years, and the people ask him to speak on all the important issues that touch on human life: family, food, work, emotions, economics, social problems, art, morality, spirituality, death, etc.On most of these issues, the prophet takes what might be called an Eastern stance. He stresses the importance of \"letting go\" rather than \"taking charge,\" whether it's in relationship to your children, conflict situations, or the end of your life.I did not find it necessary, however, to fully agree with this Eastern outlook to appreciate the book, both for its poetic beauty and for inspiring thoughts. For whatever your own worldview, a degree of \"letting go\" is an art we can all learn.- Jacob Schriftman, Author ofJob's Wager: An Alternative to Pascal's Wager and the Atheist's Wager (With Color Illustrations) A must in everyone's library for graceful poetry, inpirational reading and lessons to live by and to even to let go.  A new printing would be a welcome as the \"used\" ones in good condition are quite expensive. The Prophet dispenses ultimate wisdom to his loved ones as he bids fare well.Khalil Gibran defines all that I never had words to define, or more appropriately, did not have the good sense to define.  I discovered this book a while back and took a long time to read it since I refused to rush through it.  I read it a lesson at a time, understanding it to the best of my ability.I found a way of life in these words.  I could read it everyday and each time these words would dispense a new lesson... like a never ending treasure. Truly a classic of world literature, Gibran has snatched a chunk of wisdom from the ether--from and for the ages--and fashioned it into a masterwork. This work still holds up decades later. Every reflective, thoughtful person should have The Prophet in the home library. It can be read one chapter at a time. The chapter on love is as good as anything I've ever read. This is an excellent short book of inspirational fiction by one of the best poets of all-time. I especially love the artistic cover of this well made paperback edition. The Prophet was given to me by a good friend when my Dad passed away twenty years ago. I loved it the first time I read it and I have given several copies away to friends/family who have lost someone they loved or had a problem I thought the book could help them with. I have 2 copies at home now and I often refer to it. A book you won't want to part with. This book is poetic myth,a work of beauty,whose every word drips a truth,and a thought of knowledge.Reading it is like swimming in realitybut a reality I have not known,till now.Kahlil Kahlil Gibran knew something we did not,he shared a bit of the wonder of simplicity.Though this is merely the preaching of a Prophet,Gibran is able to turn it into story,and I feel from the gut for all the characters.The Prophet is unsurpassed in form,in content best when speaking of beauty,in ways I had never known,and weakest when speaking of prayer.Certainly Gibran relies on the story of Jesus,and throughout there are allusions to his wordsand actions.But this is a new prophet,who speaks the words of old,though it be in new wineskin. I would buy from this seller again.Kahlil Gibran was a genius. \"The Prophet\" uses a lot of old English, but is still an easy/quick read. I can see why this book has been translated into dozens of different languages. - Definitely words to live by. A poet. I was given this book as a high school graduation gift and I have found it to be the book I look to in hard times as well as good times, for advise, inspiration, hope and words of wisdom.  I highly recommend it. This book was recommended to me by a friend. What he told me of it is that, just as The Art of War, this is the book from which you take out whatever you want. What you find in it depends as much on the book as it does on you. It speaks of love, life and people in the most touching way ever. I have it in my handbag at all times. When I first read it, I cried. There is literally something mystical about it. I like to think I took a lot out of it. One of those books you should read again and again and again.. Easy read. Interesting book. I bought this book on a chance of luck & really enjoyed it. I recommend it to everyone. This is a book you can read and re-read many many times.Great and timeless thoughts about relationships, love andfriendship.  I will share this with my family. :)Jeffrey C. McAndrewauthor of &quot;Our Brown Eyed Boy&quot; Slow reading but full of Significant messages.Took long to read in order to fully capture and understandhis message. The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran is a book that's been around for a while. There are many passages in the book and many basic topics on marriage, children, friendship, work and pleasure, which will touch you in one form or another. This is a classic of world literature.  Everyone with a poet's heart, a lover's heart, a philosopher's heart, a dancer's heart, a parent's heart, a leader's heart, or simply who enjoys beauty found in life's joys and sorrows, this book is simply the best. I was in my twenties when I first read The Prophet.  I am now 65.  The Prophet has grown in the depth of its content as I have been able to understand more deeply.  This book, I believe, has the meaning of the holy writings of all the great religions.  As you read, decide if all these writings do hold the same great truths. A book to be treasured. A tremendous poet dealing mostly with Christianity and spiritual love. His insights on topics of life are to be cherished. I have read his treasured poems many times and brightened the lives of others by sharing. This book was highly inspiring during my emotional spiritual journey to discover my biological roots. I listed The Prophet as a key reference source in my book Adoption Detective: Memoir of an Adopted Child.Judith Land, AuthorAdoption Detective: Memoir of an Adopted Child I read it in an hour. Kahlil Gibran is definitely the people's philosopher. The book itself seems to be written on impulse, and the author knows what the modern world is looking for. The context is powerful and sensitive, and more than anything it's the truth. Reading a classic such as &quot;The Prophet&quot; is much more fruitful when it is revisited often, the lessons are applied and the reader reads as if Gibran is writing only to him or her.Sitting with this book in your hands can be like sitting across from Gibran, listening to him speak.  The accompanying art work also by Gibran gives it yet another rich element and peek into the soul of this incredible writer.Listen, embrace and breathe in these words.Open your mind and heart to The Prophet. Gibran gets right down to the bedrock of what it is all about.  He was obviously a very enlightened man, and The Prophet is so completely, psychologically and spiritually healthy. Anyone who would not consider this work a standard for healthy living, is simply simple-minded.  This book should be offered to all high school students as a guide in gaining perspective on what is really important in life.  I first read The Prophet about 10 years ago, and I typically read it about once a year, just to remind myself.  However, I gave my copy to my son who showed signs of being &quot;at risk&quot; at age 17.  I believe the book had a significant, positive impact on him, and he is now 20 and living a very responsible and balanced life.  After my son had read this book, I found him on the telephone one evening reading passages to a friend.  It made him think, and any time you can get a teenager to think, it's a very good thing. The book came in great condition, as well as, on time. Feel sad, though, because it was lost in a move. A short and magnificent book that will forever withstand the test of time because it speaks to, and from, the heart. Kahlil Gibran (1883-1931), the Lebanese-American poet and mystic never wrote anything finer than this 1923 volume, his masterwork. Had he written nothing before or beyond THE PROPHET, he would still be remembered into perpetuity.Each brief chapter of THE PROPHET addresses an aspect of the human condition, including Love, Marriage, Work, Pleasure, Buying and Selling, Children, Eating and Drinking, to name but a few. Gibran espouses no particular religious, ethical or moral system, and yet includes them all in this slim tome, written it seems, with a quill of light, not ink.A Higher Power (by whatever name you may call it) spoke through Gibran in the writing, a perfect letter to the ages, and an ultimate expression of Humanity. My father has this huge book collection and I remember I was around 12 when I found this book amidst a sea of books and I thought it was pretty small, so I read it in one sit...It changed my life.It talks about life, love, friendship, death, etc. All of these answers that you spend your entire life searching for...are in this book. It tells you all of these things that you already know about life, but somehow we keep in the back of our heads so we don't have to do the right thing, as if ignoring them will make us more human by default. There is no place that I go that this book doesn't follow me.I remember in college having this teacher that I despised so much and the class was talking about their favorite book and when it came my turn I said \"The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran\" and she got all excited too and said \"That's my favorite book too, it's like my Bible\"...I remember thinking \"How can I have something that is so important to me in common with someone that I despise?\"...I guess that's the thing about life...I will never forget that or her... This is Kahlil Gibran at his best.  The prophet is uplifting, thought-provoking, lyrical, simplistic, and completely unforgettable.  Gibran's unique prose poetry rythym flows like wine while reading it.  This  book is a classic. My favorite book.  I used the passaged in my wedding ceremony.  I read it over and over and never tire of it received on time and thank you for rel good on time service.HIS CHAPTER ON PAIN IS THE BEST. This book takes different themes such as work, love, etc. and poses them as questions that a community asks a wise man, who seems to be spirit talking. He is a man who is not so much of a religious base but more filled with a love of nature finding peace and depth through sensory and embracement of all dark and light. He is a person who has freedom in all areas of his life and learns from all things and all moments because of his openess and aliveness. He wants all people to gain awareness from their path thru eternity. This can be read in a variety of ways coming from each person's belief system. I read this when I was in a state of loss, loss of so much. This book can bring understanding and a shift in consciousness at least for a spell of time. It can expand who you are while you process and integrate his writings. I most definately recommend this book, for all people on their journey in whatever space they are in on their path of life. \"A brilliant man's philosophy on love, marriage, joy, sorrow, time, friendship and just life. Originally published in 1923 - translated into more than 20 languages. Also has drawings by Gibran...A poetic ,inspiring little book that you can read over and over again...\" I wanted the book the Prophet as an anniversary gift to my spouse. We read this book while dating. He had copies before but lost track by giving them away. I went to Amazon and put in the title and there it was...nothing like whatit would have cost retail. So for me it was just what I was looking for, at the price I could pay, in the condition I could use for the perfect gift for my husband. Thank You! A prophet has waited twelve years in a coastal town for the ship that will bear him back to his homeland, which he misses.Why he is there, why he is waiting, how he knows what he knows, and who he is is a mystery.  As he departs the townspeople gather to wish him well. A local seeress who knows him best asks him to share his wisdom so that it will endure for generations to come.So, he reveals his wisdom on love, birth, marriage, children, pain, talking, pleasure, death any so much more.It is a profound work, and here is his advice on marriage so you may judge for yourself:You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore.You shall be together when white wings of death scatter your days.Aye, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.But let there be spaces in your togetherness,And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.Love one another but make not a bond of love:Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup.Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf.Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping.For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.And stand together, yet not too near together:For the pillars of the temple stand apart,And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.Its not a little similar to theTao Te Ching: A New English Version (Perennial Classics)where a border guard recognises Lao Tzu, and asks him to share his wisdom as he goes into exile.  Written 2,500 years ago, and one of the most translated books in the world.  The Tao contains many principles you can use in your everyday life, and if you're not thinking in  ego based ways, your wisdom based thinking opens up..If you like one book, you will love the other, so I recommend both.  For the Tao, I recommend the Stephen Mitchell version.  Hope this was useful. This book was the first and only I've read by Kahlil Gibran. Every chapter offers insight and philosophy on almost every subject that a person can think about. From death to love to marriage to friendship Kahlil Gibran offers a very sensitive view of all aspects of life. I've reread it many times. Everyone carries an omnificent quality within themselves.  Some individuals have not grasped this concept.  Some individuals do not realize that a simple change can create a huge transformation.  Would you ask an important figure for advice before she or he left town?  Their advice would be elements about life that you already knew, but seemingly forgot. There are simple fundamentals to follow that can make you a better person within your own eyes.Gibran uses The Prophet Almustafa to enlighten readers with simple tactics they can use to live a more pure and genuine life.  How many of us love, go to work, have clothes, feel pain, and own friendships?  You do not have to be religious to appreciate this book.  Gibran's classic takes common stress factors that everyone can relate to, and shares guidance on how to simplify it in your life:  \"When you work with love, you bind yourself to yourself, and to one another\" ( p. 26).  Read this book and share it.  Think about the most valuable portion to you in this book. Share that portion with another person. Since I first read The Prophet when I was a teenager I have had a copy by my side.  It is a gift of such value in comprehending the depth and meaning of this wonderful Life in its beauty of every relationship that engages us.  Be it work, parenting, eating, death or love, Gibran paints word images of such divine and exquisite loveliness that, once read, will change the reader's perspective forever.  It is a book to refer to again and again as life unfolds and offers new opportunities for spiritual growth and awareness.It is a book I have given as a gift to many young people as they grapple with the frustrations and distortions of an often incomprehensible outer world.  It is a book of beautiful truths and a map to our own seeking souls.  I particularly love this edition which includes Gibran's original drawings. I have been reading The Prophet every year for over a decade. Or intending to. It's an incredible read. If I'm having issues in my life, I read the section that relates to my problem and it helps clarify things somewhat. It is a divinely inspired piece of work, and can be read in one setting. There is pretty much nothing that he doesn't cover in the book that can't be related to your own life. I bought the ebook version so I could have easier access. It's a book for everyone. Needed to read this and could not find my old copy, so bought a new copy and it still helps me when I need to remember what is inside this lovely collection of wisdom! I first became aware of Kahlil Gibran when I read a poem of his that was on the menu at my favorite Lebanese restaurant. Ever since then, I have sought out his books.  The Prophet is my favorite.  Several of the  &quot;poems&quot; or passages are fully relevant to parts of my life.  The  book makes one feel good and inspired to do good for others.  There is  barely an aspect on life that the poems do not touch on-love, marriage,  death and all of our own insecurities and doubts about people and life.  This would be a good book to give to a friend who is going through a rough  time, or just has unanswered questions at a certain point in their lives.  The writing is lucid, insightful, and will be relevant for as long as time  goes on.The drawings add to an already great work.  At my favorite Lebanese  restaurant, I not only found good food-I thankfully found Kahlil Gibran. I first read this book as a teenager. It has remained on my bookshelf, being read many, many times. I have given it as a gift to several people, over the years. It is one of my favourite books.The Prophet is a classic, and is considered to be Kahlil Gibran's masterpiece. Gibran himself considered it his \"greatest achievement\". Originally published in 1923, it has been translated into 28 languages, and is still a popular piece of literature today.The book is a beautiful blend of poetry and philosophy. Each chapter takes on a particular topic, or aspect of life. \"The Prophet\" speaks on love, work, law, freedom, pain, time, and many other important issues we all deal with as we journey through life. Each beautifully written chapter is also illustrated by Gibran.The importance and beauty of this book is immeasurable and timeless. This book should be on every bookshelf of those who truly enjoy the beauty of poetry and classic literature, to be enjoyed and appreciated by every generation. The life lessons offered by Kahlil Gibran are timeless in essence and belief. This was my favorite book when i was 19! So I purchased it for my 19 yr old granddaughter. Hope she loves it as much as I do! Great read! A book for the ages! Each little piece of prose/poem has something simple and profound to tell us all. Got this book for my son who wasn't familiar with Kahlil Gabran. Everyone should read him at least once don't you think? The book was more attractive than pictured and small - fits in his pocket. He likes it. This is an amazingly beautiful book.  The writings are spiritual and absolutely beautiful.  They cover almost every aspect of life and provide inspiring, poetic and though-provoking words in answer to questions raised about them.  When my mother passed away, I read this book over and over again.  Many use the chapter on marriage as part of their wedding vows.  My daughter asked me to read that chapter to her and her husband as part of their wedding ceremony.  I cannot think of a better way to spend $10.00.  You will more than get your money's worth even if you only read one chapter in the book. This is classic reading, which I did read when it was &#34;young&#34;.I was glad to find it available for Kindle. For one who would prefer Truth coming from a source other than the King James Version, \"The Prophet\" is written with the voice of wisdom and the beauty of poetry. If there is a Black and White 'Truth,' one could easily seek it here in almost all the verses. Gibran wrote the ultimate way of seeing life and living in it. the importance of each relationship. The book was written to be relatable to every reader, all the subjects are mondain. The availability of this book is a great advantage that I don't think people are aware of. It's an hour long to read, but a lifetime to understand, if you read it you'll remember it in every new life matter or relationship.Buy it and keep it on the shelve for reference, it's an answer to everything. and read it carefully. Gibran was a great author and in this book he truly shines. I recommend this book to anyone, even if he/she is not into reading. The book is short but full of wisdom. I only gave it 4 stars because the idea of the book (and even the title) are taken from \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" which I gave 5 stars. So I didnt think it would be fair to give this one an equal grading. I actually recommend both books, but The Prophet is much easier to read, while Thus Spoke Zarathustra is deeper and more intelligent. My friend Renee gave this to me a few years back and asked me to read The Prophet.  I started reading it shortly afterward and honestly had to stop for a little while because I tried consuming too much (sorry, my normal is history, historical fiction, and either sci-fi or fantasy); after all, this is poetry and philosophy and should be consumed like a fine wine or excellent scotch, slowly savoring the flavor.  Having let things slip a little longer than intended I started reading it again, this time not trying to slam thru pages but rather reading one or two passages over lunch and seeing  the impact on me.  This time things flowed somewhat better for me.  The individual passages are nicely done covering aspects of life relevant to anyone.  While I don't always agree with Mr. Gibran philosophy for a subject, some are particularly moving; for me in particular his passage on Joy and Sorrow was borderline earth shaking with his explanation of the relationship of the two, describing to me why both can be so strong.Rating this one is extremely complex.  Some passages touch you and make you think about your life or what you have; others flow over you, whether discarded for future consumption is to be determined later.  Because I wasn't touched by all, I call this a very strong 4 star book and can easily see why lovers of poetry or philosophy could call this a 5 star book.  What I can say though is thank you Renee for exposing me to The Prophet. This book was given to me as a gift before I journeyed overseas on a  spiritual quest to &quot;find myself.&quot; I never got a chance to read it  until one month after I was there and I had lost my job, my relationship  was very unsteady, and being so far form home, I felt completely isolated.  After skipping around the book and reading sections that immediately  pertained to me at that point, I cried, not out of sadness, but out of  enlightenment...Gibran wrote his experiences,and his thoughts on life, but  they are such detailed poetic accounts, it applies to everyone at some  time, his writings have layers, and therefore this book can be read many  times over, and each time a new understanding will come. &quot;Your pain is  the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding...&quot; My brother was looking for this book and I ordered it for him.  I was pleased with the price and the fact I could have it shipped directly to him.  Thanks Amazon! Being an Atheist, it may seem strange to some people that this book holds any meaning for me, but I think that, despite the religious references, people from all walks of life will relate to the poetic prose of The Prophet.Kahlil Gibran has been greatly celebrated in several countries for the book's simple yet biting phrases. Any two sentences in this legacy of living can be made into a thought-altering quote.Gibran uses a prose style throughout. Short lines of words written as freestyle poetry create a rich medium to deliver his words.Each section has something poweful to say, but some of my favorites were those on Work, Giving, Children, Crime and Punishment, Freinds, Time, and of course Love.As oppposed to most books containing the word \"Prophet\" anywhere in the title, Gibran expresses life as something to be enjoyed and soaked in as many ways as possible. The book does not stress the punishment of sins, but to bask in pleasure and not look back. Decadence is not suggested, but the basic purpose of Gibran's legacy is to tell us that life is short and must be lived without regrets.It is a book that includes such beautiful metaphors and velvetty language that you are always sucked into reading \"just one more section.\" What makes the book work is not just the simple genius of the author's statements, but also the beauty of his words, the flow of his language.I hate to be like everyone else (in more instances than just this), but it does change you. It states what any prophecy should, and allows the religious aspects of the beliefs to take the backseat to the love of life and aspirations.Buy, read, and live by The Prophet's words. I bought this book for my son who had his stolen from him and was in despair.  He likes the beautiful poetic resonance and in looking through the book, I agree.  This is a book for sensitive souls, beautifully written and illustrated by the author. A classic which has only improved with time.  The thoughts and ideas in this book would make the world a better place! I can't think of a title fitting enough. What can you say about a book that you believe to be one-of-a-kind? I have yet to find a book that I can compare it to. I suppose I could at least explain why I find this book to be so unique.First of all this book covers most all of life's complex issues in the simplest fashion, and in that respect it is uncanny in presentation. Secondly and astonishingly the author portrays a story of a prophet speaking to his people, but I cannot be so shallow to think that I am reading a said story... I am not reading the said story--what is actually happening is that I am the listener and Kahlil Gibran is the prophet himself.  I strongly feel that if you the reader do not come away with this feeling yourself, you are probably reading some other book.I think what would do justice in this review is to explain some feelings you may get from a brief reading, in fact with that said, I can state with confidence that many readers will peruse only a few pages at a time because the content is overwhelming in its ability to provoke thought and feeling. You may feel at times that some all important life questions are being answered. You may feel regret  like I did,  I regret not having this book earlier in life to help me. I believe that a great many of you will feel amazed. It is truly amazing how such a short simple book can have such a profound impact on a person searching for answers to life's puzzles.There is a quote from the \"Urantia Book\" that is appropriate in closing this review. The quote helps to sum up one of the unexpected feelings I received from this incredible story, and that quote is.. \"The argumentative defense of any proposition is inversely proportional to the truth contained.\" ...and I give this quote because this book gives you the feeling that you are reading divine truth. I am a firm believer that if Kahlil Gibran is not a modern day prophet, no one is, and you too may come away with this belief because this is a story that really speaks to the heart of humanity. I cannot think of anyone who would not love this book. I've always been wary of stories claiming ownership of principles of truth and wisdom, and attempting to package them in tidy, marketable portions for mass consumption.  However, I found this novella unique and unpretentious in it's delivery of many truths that at first glance may appear intuitive, but in reality escape me in the daily practice of my life.  It was a well-written, thought-provoking tale that helped me focus on the most important things of my daily life. My intention here is to comment on the quality of this reading, rather than the timeless content, the quality of which is well known.I very much enjoyed Paul Sparer's reading. I found his rich bass voice and eloquent style ideal for Gibran and very pleasing to listen to. Unlike another reviewer, I was not at all distracted by the music; in fact, I barely noticed it. Taste in such things is a personal issue, and for what it's worth, this reading very much suits my tastes. I have loved this book since I first acquired it decades ago...a classic in every since of the word. I have always kept a book copy, had to have an e-copy too. Gibran's words strike as deep and sudden as lightning, and lay bare to you, with unbelievable simplicity, the truths of human life. And they do so beautifully. To read this book is to enrich yourself, enlighten yourself, and to enjoy some of the most beautiful words ever written. Gibran's accompanying drawings are as mystical and moving as his words, and accentuate the utterances of the Prophet.The sheer wisdom and beauty of this little book is undeniable. All hail the Prophet. Here is a book that will get your spiritual side working again.  This book subscribes to no particular religion(s), but gives much to reflect upon.  This is a short book.  It will only take you around an hour or so to read it.  But if you want to take a break from the hectic day-to-day lives we lead and think about the deeper meanings of life, this book is for you.  It's the story of a prophet that comes to a town and gives the townspeople his wisdom.  They ask him questions about life, and he gives them deep spiritual answers.  Simple concept, great read. I recently read an article in The New Yorker Magazine about Kahlil Gibran, writer born in the middle east to Christian parents. Kahlil Gibran managed to immigrate to NYC with his mother and siblings.  Gibran's personal life and his early death, his exotic looks and ability to both write and paint is what attracted me to read his masterpiece \"The Prophet\".  It is a mystic story, written in verse, less than 100 ages long with a dozen fantastic paintings that remind of magical realism in painting.  The book is a manifest on how to live, love, work, dress, embrace joy and sorrow, accept righteousness and mankind far from perfection.  It is a book of duality that in the most beautiful language a young philosopher teaches the ways to live life.  No matter what world, culture, continent or country one comes from,this verse is universal.  If anything, this piece of work has compelled me to seek out other of Gibran's work.  I need to get into a mind of this wonderful thinker who himself led a very complicated and solitary life.  It has been a long time since I read anything as beautiful and touching as this piece of literature. I am almost 51 years old. When i was 18 and deeply conflicted, weighted down with the confusions that can only be so impossibly painful at that young age, my mother gave me a hardback copy of \"The Prophet\". I've carried it with through all these years as a treasured companion. It helped me make sense of the non-sense my life was back there in 1974, and has comforted me more then a couple times in the years since then, as well.Today i'm here at Amazon to buy the same book for my 19-year-old daughter. She's a bright, warm, funny, sweet girl who is undergoing no small amount of angst as her comfy girlhood world slips away.  Her friends have begun to scatter to the winds--some to jobs and some to college--and her own adult responsibilities loom ever taller.Why, she has asked me, why do i feel so sad? I have no reason to be so sad--but i am. Why?And my mind has flashed to:\"Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.And how else can it be?\"So i want this book for my wonderful daughter.  I think she's ready for it and, better, i think it will help the turmoil in her soul as it did for me when i was her age, and for my mother before me. Inspirational and true teachings about various aspects of life are what you will find when you read this beautiful book. The book is short, 96 pages, and includes artwork by the author. The short chapters begin with various people (a ploughman, a judge, a woman, a rich man, an old priest, a mason, a hermit, etc.)asking the mystic to speak about different subjects of life, such as:  On Beauty, On Good and Evil, On Marriage, On Joy and sorrow, on friendship, and many more)I have to say that if I had come across this book much earlier in my life, I know I would not have understood or appreciated the beauty of it. I mentioned a quote from this book to a friend once who told me that her mother in law gave her the book years ago, and she had never read it. I told her what a treasure it was and after (finally) reading it, she loved it too.There is so much wisdom here to learn from. This is an incredible book! I am alive like you, and I am standing beside you.Close your eyes and look around, you will see me in front of you.~Gibran's words on his EpitaphThe Prophet captures the teachings of Kahlil Gibran in a comforting story that succinctly touches on everyday topics like love, giving, joy, sorrow, freedom, pain, teaching, friendship and beauty. Within each tiny chapter, profound moments can occur as we are given insight into unfamiliar territory, a place of thought not commonly existing in daily life but familiar to spiritual teachers.Kahlil Gibran magically explores the connection between sorrow and joy and how the deeper the sorrow you experience, the more joy you can contain. Talking becomes thoughts that can no longer \"dwell in the solitude of your heart\" so they \"live in your lips.\"As Almustafa waits for a ship to take him back to the isle of his birth, he climbs a hill outside the city walls and looks out to sea. When his \"ship arrives\" he is suddenly filled with regret, yet knows he must follow his destiny and return home.\"Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and his aloneness without regret?\"The priests and priestesses ask him to remain in very poetic ways: \"Let not the waves of the sea separate us now, and the years you have spent in our midst become a memory.\"Almustafa only cries and doesn't seem to speak until a woman named Almitra appears. She is a woman who believed in him and he seems to have great fondness for her. We are not given any insight into their relationship, but his respect for her is unquestioned. She understands he must leave, but asks him to give the city his wisdom. She promises they will pass this wisdom down through the generations.While viewing pictures of Bsharri in Northern Lebanon, the mountains and the mist are almost a unique doorway into Kahlil Gibran's mind. He lived in a lush region where cascading falls, rugged cliffs and cedar trees influenced his art and writing.We can imagine his thoughts of home and this book was actually first imagined when he wrote a short story as a teenager. A Bostonian poet, Josephine Peabody, caught Gibran's attention at an art exhibition and she later referred to him as \"her young prophet.\"  She also wrote poems about Gibran's life and how she imagined his life in Bsharri. His life is woven into his writing in the most beautiful ways. He names his book for a woman he loves and his writing is infused with spiritual teachings and influences from his journey from Lebanon to New York.The story has an unassuming plot, but the lessons are eternal and the ending is surprisingly tender. I was left with a sense of longing that is still drifting along with me like the mists of Bsharri. The Prophet is not just a book to read, it is a spiritual journey to experience. It may take three or more days to complete the reading of this tiny book. I could only read about a third at a time because it is saturated in wisdom and many of the chapters want to be read and read again, until they are absorbed into your soul and written on your heart.\"But if you love and must needs have desires,let these be your desires:To melt and be like a running brook thatsings its melody to the night.\" ~Kahlil Gibran~The Rebecca Review When i ordered this book i knew it was worth it. The Prophet teaches us about life with its pains, sorrows, joy and love and much more. This book deserves more than five stars, i highly recommend it. The prevailing popularity of Gibran's PROPHET lies in only one secret: he writes his poems with readers in his mind. The compassionate poet I come to know through his lines, Gibran did not write to impress, shock or confuse but to communicate truth with highest poetic beauty. THE PROPHET addresses 27 essential subjects of life that concerns everyone - love, freedom, children, work, self-knowledge, friendship, time, beauty, death to name a few. I have this book for many years but this is a kind of poetry that ripens with time and each time you take a sip, it still surprises you with refreshing revelations. Also recommended are his less known books, A TEAR AND A SMILE, SAND AND FOAM and THE GARDEN OF THE PROPHET. Seldom has there been a book that I have read time and time again as much as this one.  I have given this book numerous times to people as a small gift.  I have used this book in my son's christening when he was a baby and on numerous holidays.  These words are every bit as relevant when they were written.  For all time, this book still ranks in my top 5. \"The Prophet\" is a supreme literary achievement that has impacted millions of people around the globe. The Prophet has been translated into many languages and has sold millions of copies. Gibran's chef-d'oeuvre will provide the reader with an ecstatic, refined, and transcending literary experience !!! The Prophet is an elegant and beautifully crafted piece of art that eloquently states Universal Truths concerning all pertinent aspects of ourlive. These include love, death, justice, art, etc. It's divine poetr that could have only been inspired by the creator of this magnificent world.Highly recommended. This is a very usefull book that can be used as a secondary source for your primary religious texts. Not only does it give you excellent prophetic sayings, but when reading anyone could have a diffrent interpretation. Here is some things you could look to find:-Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.-Say not, \"I have found the truth,\" but rather, \"I have found a truth.\"-Say not, \"I have found the path of the soul,\" but rather, \" I have met the soul walking upon my path.\"  For the soul walks upon all paths.-You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts.-For what is evil, but good tortured by it's own hunger and thurst.-And beauty is not a need, but an ecstasy.-Who can seperate his faith from his actions, or his belief from his occupation.-To judge you by your failures is to cast blame upon the seasons for their inconsistency.-No man can reveal to you aught but that wich is already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge.-If he is indeed wise he does not bid you enter the house of his wisdom, but rather leads you to the threshhold of your own mind.-And even as each of you stands alone in god's knowledge, so must each of you be alone in his knowledge of God and his understanding of the earth. I recently reread this after many years and found the words to resonate with wisdom and spiritual centeredness. The book can be enjoyed and read with profit by people from all faiths and traditions. Each will find some treasure that speaks to their heart. There is nothing in THE PROPHET that would contradict or conflict with any of the sacred texts of the world's major religions. It somehow encompasses the teachings of all of them in a secular and beautiful work of literature. One of the best books written in English, ever.  Simple, yet extremely penetrating like &#34;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&#34;, deeply thought-provoking like &#34;Stranger in a Strange Land&#34;, semantically precise yet as moving as the Psalms of David, Gibran's masterpiece is timeless. This is a wonderful expression of some of the fundamental truths of human nature and existence. This little book is always on my desk and every now and I revisit it again and ruminate over the wisdom that Al Mustafa gives to the people of the city of Orphalese.As Al Mustafa prepares to leave Orphalese after 12 years, the seeress Almitra implores,\"Yet this we ask ere you leave us, that you speak to us and give us of your truth.And we shall give it unto our children, and they unto their children, and it shall not perish.In your aloneness you have watched with our days, and in your wakefulness you have listened to the weeping and laughter of our sleep.Now therefore disclose us to ourselves, and tell us all that has been shown you of that which is between birth and death.\"...and thus begins the beautiful explanation of love, marriage, children, houses, clothes, teaching, talking, religion and many more. Actually you can read this entire book online, so you don't necessarily need to purchase one to enjoy it. Some of my favorite ones include, On Houses, On Teaching, On Talking and On religion.and he parts by saying ,\"Less hasty am I than the Wind, yet I must go.We wanderers, ever seeking the lonelier way, begin no day where we have ended another day; and no sunrise finds us where sunset left us\" Quote from The Prophet &#34;You are good when you walk to your goal firmly and bold steps. Yet you are not evil when you go thither limping. Even those who limp go not backwards&#34;.This book has wise views from the author about all areas of our lives like love, marriage, crime, knowledge, pain...etc, it's written in semi poetic way with simple writing. This is an excellent book.  it arrived in good shape.  i have loaned it out to other people.  they are astounded that it is a used book This book never ages, it is sincerely ageless... I love the Prophet and tend to buy copies to give to people who may need it's message.  I don't ever loan mine out because it never comes back!  This book speaks on all matters human!  I've owned it since I was 14 and go back to it constantly.  I especially love the sections on children, love and marriage.  It's a wonder insightful read and I highly recommend it.  It's also rather spiritual which is lovely.  It's not like the bible, but easy to read and take in.  It can give you peace when you need it.  Please consider adding it to your library. This book still holds all the philosophical magic 70 years after Gibran wrote it.  He managed to distill some basic truths about life and they are as applicable now as they were then. Have had this particular book for many years. I have given it to family and friends. Especially young  woman. For me, it put life in proper perspective and especially helpful when both my children moved to Europe. Think there is something for everyone. One of the classics that everyone should read. It is also one of the most profound books that is this short. Pure mastery in words revealing the essence of life. Very simply, this book speaks to everyone. It doesn't matter who you are or what you believe. It brings tears to me each time I read it, because if your mind is open, you will achieve a feeling of higher existence upon completion of your reading. I hope you will take that understanding and infuse it within all you do.I also recommend listening to Richard Harris' reading of this book, though it may be out of print these days. I can never quite make up my mind on this book. I read it years ago and was also somewhat puzzled by it. Rereading it I feel vague inspiring feeling, and the other a kind of vague repulsion. I see many many readers are inspired by the work. I myself feel it to be a kind of sentimental popular mixture of Whitman and Zarathustra, but without the great lyric sweeping of the former or the fierce intellectual irony of the latter.I believe the most famous section of the work of twenty- six poetic essays is the one on 'Love\"Here is some of this:\"Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;For love is sufficient unto love.When you love you should not say, \"God is in my heart,\" but rather, I am in the heart of God.\"And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires: To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.To know the pain of too much tenderness.To be wounded by your own understanding of love;And to bleed willingly and joyfully.To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy;To return home at eventide with gratitude;And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.I am reminded when I read this of Bellow's description of the healer in 'Seize the Day' Dr. Temkin. On the one hand he says and thinks that it is phony  , and on the other he hears certain things and says ' True , True.'.I must admit my reaction remains mixed. I do not feel it is really poetic truth of the highest value, but I do not feel it is without value either. Should we, could we all walk through life in such an enlightened state? What a wonderful peaceful world it would be. How can we deny that Kahlil Gibran was directed by the Gods to deliver a message: \"be as one, live in the light, love is the only answer!\" and so I paraphrase, but in truth, it is a way of life that is essential to the well-being of mankind. If I have ever read a book that is timeless, other than the Word of God, it would have to be this one.  Although I may not have agreed with every word written, so many of the words of wisdom within these pages brought peace and comfort to me.I read this book many, many years ago.  I quoted from it at times and thought of it often. The words seemed to wrap themselves around your heart and spring out in times of need. There are not many books that can stake that claim, and I have read many.A classic in my opinion and a book that will never be outdated.Recommended. I first stumbled across Gibran in a quote a firend shared with me while I was going through a divorce. The quotes on Pain, Joy and Sorrow, and Love became touchstones. This is a very touching perceptive work. I highlighted or wanted to highlight almost every word.  So much beautiful metaphor, and profound wisdom here.  I wish everyone read this and took it to heart. This is a very beautiful book. It contains a lovely section on marriage, emphazing the importance of seperate identities between lovers. This may be a short book, but it is full of insight. It is perfect to dip into at odd moment for that renewed spiritual focus or uplift, or just as good to read in one sitting. It is a classic with good reason and cuts to the core with it's deceptively simple style. There is much depth to this book to be explored and comes highly recommended.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page. Have you ever read a line, first you feel the language is beautiful and next a thought, even a reality hits you? And even after you have finished, the message keeps playing on and on in your mind? Well, this book is one of them (if you have luckily found other books by other author).It is the exploration of self, soul, community, nature, and universe. No matter what religion you hold, from where you came or who/what you are. This is a book for every human being to know and keep in perspective what they are doing everyday. Like watching an Olympic athlete or listening to an accomplished singer reading Khalil Gibran is in many ways indescribeable.In that way, it's good that many of the other reviewers have tried to describe this book by giving anectodes of how it personally touched them.  But ultimately those anectodes are like the stories of people who've gone to some great vacation spot.Sure, they can tell you how they felt enjoying its weather or appreciating its beauty but such descriptions will never compare to you taking your own personal journey there.Because of the way this book is written, some of its passages will no doubt touch you more than others but it is beyond doubt that you will emerge touched and having that rare feeling of connecting with someone only through the medium of the printed word.I wish we could award more than five stars.  I wish it could be an infinity...for every heart touched by this wonderful, wonderful book. I turn to The Prophet for perspective whenever life gets distorted and seems to be on its own track. This book offers poetic and visionary commentary on some of the most vital points of living, and does so in a creative, thought-provoking way. I first learned of Kahlil Gibran and The Prophet during a sermon at a Unitarian Universalist church, and I ran to get the book. It's occupied an important place on my bookshelf ever since. It helps me realize that life is a process, and letting go is a big part of moving forward. It also reminds me to be mindful of how I think about and interact with the world. It keeps things in perspective. The Prophet is an inspirational read. I have no memory of buying this book but I had it when I was a kid and loved it. Maybe I should buy it again . I have no idea where it is now Great little book full of (seemingly) common sense.  Should be read by any judgemental person or religomanic.  Should be cheaper! I just love Gibran. I have most of his writings. It took him 9 years to finish this little book, and it is so spiritual, not religious. It is a book of love. I highly recommend this work to everyone. At least 6 out of 5 stars! \"The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain\", is my favourite quote from this classic book of magical mystical poetry and philosophy. There is insight and wisdom on every page. 25 years after someone first leant me a copy, it seems to have more relevance to life's fundamental challenges than ever.Kahlil Gibran tells the story of Almastafa's departure from the city of Orphalese. As he leaves, the prophet (Almastafa) shares his thoughts on just about every aspect of the human experience. \"Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding\", \"Work is love made visible\", \"And think not that you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course\".However \"The Prophet\" is much more than a few inspiring self-help quotes. More a case of some of the deepest Eastern wisdom, universally applicable to the human condition. Long may it continue to inspire countless numbers of people around the world. It is a true masterpiece in which almost every, if not every word counts.  I have read it over and over again, since a girlfriend gave me a copy just before I left for Berkeley to attend law school.  I have given copies to many friends, and recommended to others that they buy it and read it carefully.There is enormous wisdom in each chapter, especially given the materialistic and secular world in which we live - which often seems for many people to be devoid of meaning or any spiritual underpinnings.  Gibran cuts through to the beauty and essence of Life, and his words are just as profound today as when they were written in the early years of the last century.This book should be recommended reading for any young person who is old enough to wonder what Life is really all about.  Indeed, it can be picked up at any age, and it offers insights that are brilliant and beautifully written.I urge anyone, who is thinking about buying it, to do so.  Just peruse a copy at a local bookstore or library, and you are apt to become enthralled.  It may take several readings to soak up its essence; and even after many years, I still find nuances and learn more each time I reread it. \"Say not, 'I have found the truth,' but rather, 'I have found a truth.'\"--Kahlil GibranAs you read, Gibran's poetry brings spiritual and visual beauty to life within you.  Gibran is justly famous for rich metaphors that brilliantly highlight the pursuit of Truth and Goodness amidst all the darkness and light of human nature.This is a book to read alone or with a partner, to give and receive, to go back to again and again.Note: the excerpts available in Amazon's \"Search This Book\" facility unfortunately do not do \"The Prophet\" justice, since only the book's introduction is included, whereas the wisdom does not begin unfolding until a bit later.  Therefore I've taken the liberty of including here another excerpt which more properly demonstrates the gentle power of Gibran's writing.---And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, \"Speak to us of Children.\"And he said:Your children are not your children.They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.They come through you but not from you,And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.You may give them your love but not your thoughts.For they have their own thoughts.You may house their bodies but not their souls,For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable. Great book; I shared with my co-workers and haven't gotten it back yet so everyone at work is enjoying the book as much as I did.... A very short book, only 133 pages published in 1926. To be honest I have no idea why I downloaded this. I have a vague memory of listening to a radio programme on the author some time ago, which I found interesting, so it must have been that!  Gibran is described in Wikipedia as, 'the third best selling poet of all time, behind Shakespeare and Laozi.'The book is written in bible-esque so if you are not a fan of that or indeed of religion it may not be a book for you.  On the other hand and bearing in mind this was published in 1926 almost every passage can be related to every single one of us and our lives today.There are no chapter numbers in this short volume but they are defined by the questions asked of 'The Prophet' by the assembled town folk as he prepares to leave them, returning to his 'home'.MarriageChildrenGivingEating and DrinkingWorkJoy and SorrowCrime and PunishmentFreedomReason and PassionPainTeachingFriendshipGood and EvilPrayerPleasureReligionDeathSo many of the words written by Gibran over 80 years ago, must surely, if you are tempted to purchase this book, resonate with something in your life today and his simple but reasoning outlook will remind you to step back and reflect on how you look at life and maybe think that there is something that you can do to change, for the better, on how you interact with others and with yourself!I'm not saying that I have had a religious or moral epiphany while reading this book, I personally still have no idea whether I am an atheist, agnostic or just a plane old fence sitter waiting for something different or better to come along, if that is indeed possible.  I did write somewhere in regard to the Bible, and I suppose in the same tone the Koran would be included, that I look upon the former as a good novel and if only more people would read it (them) without the religious zealotry and bigotry surrounding it (them), the world would probably be a far better place for all humankind, but that aint gonna happen.  But that should not take away from the fact that there are important life lessons in these works that are as relevant today as they were when they were written, as Mr Gibran's words, I believe, fall firmly within that description.Enjoy.....Editing for Kindle: 4 out 5Reading Enjoyment: 5 out of 5Plot:Overall Rating: 5 out of 5Chapters:Page length: 133 Beautiful, wholly accessible, brought tears to my eyes.  As graceful as Jesus' parables must have been when freshly spoken, without the distortion of time and culture and multiple translations.  The Prophet had been on my list of \"oh yeah, I've heard about it and probably should read it one day\" books.  A friend's recommendation bumped it from there into my Kindle.  This is the book that motivated me to learn how to underline and save notes, the Kindle equivilent of dog-earing my favorite parts.  (Somehow less satisfying than a dog-ear, but really easy to retrieve later.)Other books that have made it from the list to my shopping cart sit largely unread because they are just too much work.  I probably won't read Don Quixote, for example, until I'm sitting on the Spanish Med and polishing my classic Spanish.  Easy AND good for you.  How perfect is that? Gibran may be a poet, rather than a true prophet - but the simple truths in this book seem applicable to all religions. The short passages on love, children, pain, beauty, death and other timeless topics are full of insight and inspiration, but completely lacking in the politics and self-righteousness that pervade so many religions. This book is goodness, plain and simple, and it changed my life more than any other book I can recall reading. I plan to buy this book,and a few others,that I had a long time ago. To write a better review I would need to refresh myself on Eastern or Middle Eastern mysticism;Persian more specifically,Sufism and also the background of Kahlil Gibran.What I can say is that these small stories or parables or fables are Zen-like; thought-provoking and instructive. I loved this book when I read it and I wrote one of my (still) best poems while I was in the state of mind this book put me in. (I'm positive it was just after I turned 16 because I have memories connected to reading it in my room with an open window and hearing a Friday night football game in the distance from the high school...and not wanting to go to another football game because I had to free my friend from the outside port-a-potty after my other friend thought she was being funny and held the door closed when the other girl was going to come out....and naturally my claustrophobic friend started screaming and freaking out. She did the same thing I would do.Anyone of any age can enjoy this book,I just wish I had a copy around so I could refresh my memory and do a more detailed review. Of course I'm sure I would have read it more than the one time I read it, if I did have the same copy I had when I was a teenager. I always read books I really like more than one time.This book and The Little Prince by Saint Exupery;Siddhartha,Demian and Steppenwolf (all by Herman Hesse) are books I read at the same time period and that I also don't have anymore,either because I gave my copy to someone;or,had bought another copy for myself and also gave that copy away, or,they just went the way of all things,as things go...in time (and my 16th birthday was quite awhile ago...sigh.... 16 has also \"gone the way of all things\"....but not completely!)Anyone who likes The Prophet (or any of the other titles I mentioned) can consider themselves lucky if they have a friend who has read,or who has one of these books on their bookshelves;or who has a friend that would also appreciate this type of literature. (It's  \"A Beatles Thing\". Not so much connected to The Beatles, but people who like the same type of music always like their friends more,when their friends like the same type of music that they like. Beatles, Zeppelin,Pink Floyd,Rob Zombie, Black Sabbath or Godsmack...Or Johann Sebastian Bach...writing or music,it's still art. And we just feel more comfortable with people who have interests or feelings or an intellect similar to our own. ....Aesthetic magnetism is a vibration more in tune with the spirit;and everyone is in love with their soul-mate(s)...to have common ground; or be in sympathy with one another on a deeper level than the common plane of the inescapable movements of the mundane.)....Anyone reading The Prophet,and finding themselves on common ground with the author,will find gratification,and will know exactly what I mean in what I wrote in this short review. The Prophet Almustafa waits in the city of Orphalese for his ship to take him home.  For twelve years he has loved, cried, laughed, taught, dreamt, and lived with strangers.  He is joyous when he sees the sails on the horizon.  &quot;Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and aloneness without regret?&quot;What can a poor man leave for those he has learned to love?  Almustafa walks through the city, across the sands, toward the shore; as he does, he pauses to answer the questions of the heart.  &quot;Nor is it a thought I leave behind me, but a heart made sweet with hunger and thirst.&quot;His words will pass from generation to generation in Orphalese.  The metaphor is reality, for the wisdom of his celebration of life is as powerful today as it was when it was published in 1923.Some of my favorite passages are:Of Joy and Sorrow -- &quot;The deeper the sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.  Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven?&quot;Of Giving -- &quot;You give but little when you give of your possessions.  It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.&quot;Of Reason and Passion -- &quot;Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafaring soul.&quot;Of Time -- &quot;You would make a stream upon whose bank you would sit and watch its flowing.  Yet, the timeless in you is aware of life's timelessness.  And knows that yesterday is but today's memory and tomorrow is today's dream.&quot;Each phrase carries you from one thought to another.  The profoundness of his truth is not gleaned until the words are read many times.  The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran is extraordinary, and will always be one of my favorite books of philosophy, poetry, wisdom, mysticism, and prose.Victoria Tarrani Gibran's Prophet is the best example of how simple prose can be used to convey deep and powerful statement. As the name suggests, the book just recounts some sermons given by a prophet. The themes discussed include love, family, friendship, freedom, etc. This is one of those classsics that one must own and read every once in a while, for the wisdom in these words is bound to make every reader a better, completer person. It is a spiritual prose, full of deep insight and inspiration for one and all.Some qoutes that I particularly like:And ever it has been that love knows not his own depth until the hour of separation.When love beckons to you, follow him, though his ways are hard and steep.Work is love made visible.Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy can it contain.Your house is your larger body.And how shall you punish those whose remorse is already greater than thier misdeeds.For reason, ruling alone is a force confining;And passion, unattended is a flame that burns to its own destruction.Your pain is breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.For self is a sea, boundless and measureless.For vision of one man lends not its wings to another man.In longing for your giant self lies your goodness and that longing is in all of you.Trust your dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity. The Prophet is one of those books that you refer to often over the years.  And to have it on my Kindle, so I can take it anywhere, is a real treat! I admire the philosophy of this author. This book is ageless and inspirational, should be one of those mandatory books for high school. Beautifuly written book, and as you read it again over the years you find more and more meaning in it. Book offers amazing Philosphy and at the same time delivers perspective on any thing life. The Prophet is a must read. My mother read this book a long time ago and recommended it to me but I never read it. I just recentlyu read in (June 2006) and glad I finally did. This book short essays on the different aspects of life. These are teachings and they are meant to inspire and advise. They are written in such a way so that the words are not rammed down your throat. Just reread The Prophet for the umpteenth time.  Still love it and its insights into many issues.  Great quotable texts.  Everyone should read this and reflect-not the same as agreeing--on what Gibran says. Not to be confused with THE good Book. Typical eastern philosophy and good food for thought. I liked this book. I thought it was inspiring. I've been a fan of this wonderful book since my college days (back in the dark ages).  It contains many wonderful thoughts that will always inspire. This book could easily be a text for religious and non religious people to live by. Great remarks on death, love, life, or anything.Check it out. Khalil Gibran's The Prophet is a truly awe inspiring work of prosaic poetry.  Despite being a native-born Arabic speaker, Gibran wrote The Prophet in English, ensuring that his powerful words lost nothing in translation.The work's 28 short chapters recount the words of a prophet as he leaves his home to depart on a new journey.  The words that flow from the prophet's mouth and onto the pages are philosophical and spiritual treatises on all aspects of life.  Chapters discuss the range of human experiences and include discussions such as \"On Friendship\", \"On Pain\" and \"On Death.\"  What unites the 28 chapters is Gibran's thought provoking and probing literary style as Gibran's prophet invokes his listeners to live life to the fullest.  The book is not overtly religious but every word and sentence is filled with a spiritual clarity.The book is eminently quotable with every chapter providing a nugget of truth worthy of repeating.  Amazingly, Gibran packs his masterpiece into less than 100 pages, making it a very quick and easy read.  Readers will find themselves returning to The Prophet again and again to recapture the beauty of Gibran's words.The Prophet, which Gibran himself recognized as his greatest masterpiece, is a timeless literary classic.  Its truth has touched generations of readers and will undoubtedly continue to do so.\n"
